## The Story (So Far)

The house was eating the rain.

Ameena Zainal, 28, architectural historian from London, returns to a Malaysian state she left at seven to inherit her grandmother's colonial estate. In the caretaker's cottage, she finds a ledger—not of accounts, but of names. Pairs of names: colonizers and servants who died on the same dates, stretching back a century. The last entry: her own mother.

The *rumah besar* stands waiting, its shutters closed like sealed eyes, its walls covered in photographs that form a chaotic mosaic of the house's many occupants: British planters, Japanese officers, Communist insurgents, development consultants. In every photo, if you look at the edges, the local faces appear—watching, serving, remembering.

As Ameena investigates the paired deaths and the estate's tangled ownership claims, she discovers that the house itself is a kind of witness—and that the land has its own ledger, its own memories, its own claims. When a surveyor arrives to carve the property for a development trust, Ameena must choose: accept the legal fiction of ownership drawn on paper, or defend the deeper truth inscribed in stone, stream, and story.

## Core Themes (Optional Guidance)

Contributors may explore:

- **Colonial Memory as Haunting** - The ghosts aren't supernatural; they're historical. What happens when a place remembers what its occupants prefer to forget?
- **Land Rights vs. Paper Rights** - Legal ownership versus the older claims of presence, cultivation, and relationship.
- **Inheritance as Obligation** - What does it mean to inherit not just property, but the debts and crimes that property enabled?
- **The Postcolonial Gothic** - Horror that emerges not from the unknown, but from the deliberately buried.

| Write the story from the house's perspective across its 150 years | Experimental |
| Explore one of the paired deaths in full detail—what really happened? | Character |

### Structural Entry Points

## Creative Permission

You may:

- **Copy** - verbatim, in part or whole
- **Remix** - change anything, keep anything
- **Transform** - new genre, new characters, new world
- **Commercialize** - yes, sell it, we don't care
- **Fork** - create independent works
- **Claim** - make it yours

**Ownership is intentionally zero.**

---

## What Works (Build On This)

- **Atmospheric prose** - the jungle, the rain, the house as presence
- **The ledger conceit** - paired names as mystery and accusation
- **Ameena's voice** - grounded, academic, but permeable to strangeness
- **The land as character** - streams that sing, stones that warm, paths that remember

## What Needs Work (Opportunities)

- **The middle sections** may feel repetitive; contributors can tighten or expand
- **Supporting characters** (Daniel, the surveyor) could be deepened
- **The resolution** invites alternative endings—triumph, tragedy, ambiguity

**These aren't bugs - they're entry points.**
