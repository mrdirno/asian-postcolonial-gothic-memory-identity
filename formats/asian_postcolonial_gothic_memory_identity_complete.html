<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1-1">CHAPTER 1</h2>
<p>Mama’s ghost arrived on a Tuesday, wearing her own face. She sat in
the rattan chair by the monsoon window, the one with the cracked cane
seat, and began to unpack the contents of her handbag: a tube of
lipstick, a single jade earring, and the smell of clove cigarettes and
damp earth.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a sound, but a digestion. The monsoon downpour hit the
corrugated tin roof of the old servants’ quarters, a frantic, metallic
drumming, but where it struck the main house—the <em>rumah
besar</em>—the water was swallowed. The ancient <em>belian</em> wood,
iron-hard and black as a forgotten secret, drank the noise. All that
reached me, huddled on the porch of my late grandmother’s caretaker
cottage, was a deep, wet sigh, as if the place were drawing breath.</p>
<p>I’d been here three hours. The key from the solicitor’s envelope was
cold in my palm, its teeth biting my skin. I hadn’t gone in. Not
yet.</p>
<p>The air was the colour of old tea, thick with the smell of wet earth,
frangipani, and something else—the faint, sweet-rot scent of champaca
flowers gone to mush on the ground. My suitcase, a stupid, wheeled
European thing, was already bleeding rust onto the concrete step. I’d
packed for a week. The letter said a week would be enough. Sign papers,
oversee the initial clearing, release the property to the historical
trust. A formality. I was the last branch, the final echo. Ameena
Zainal, 28, architectural historian, London-based, summoned back to a
peninsula she’d left at seven, to a state she could not name on a map,
to a house she remembered only as a smear of green and a feeling of
suffocation.</p>
<p>“You’ll stay in the <em>rumah kecil</em>,” the solicitor, Mr. Goh,
had said over a crackling line. “The small house. Your grandmother’s
instructions. The big house… it is best not to sleep there. Damp.”</p>
<p>His pause had been a geography of its own.</p>
<p>The rain slackened, thinning to a murmur. The jungle at the edge of
the cleared garden breathed out a wave of steam. That’s when I saw the
figure.</p>
<p>A woman stood at the treeline, where the untamed green began its
siege on the lawn. She was utterly still, a vertical stroke of grey
against the boiling chlorophyll. She wore a <em>kebaya</em>, but one of
a cut I’d only seen in photographs—high-necked, fastened with ornate
<em>kerongsang</em> brooches, the fabric faded to the colour of ash. Her
hair was a tight silver bun. She was looking at the <em>rumah
besar</em>.</p>
<p>My breath hitched. A neighbour? A relic?</p>
<p>I stood, the damp wood of the porch creaking under my weight.
“Hello?”</p>
<p>She didn’t turn. Her gaze remained fixed on the two-storey colonial
structure, its once-white paint peeling like leprous skin, its black
shutters closed like sealed eyes. The wide verandah wrapped around it, a
slack embrace.</p>
<p>“<em>Mak cik</em>?” I tried again, my Malay clumsy, childhood
vocabulary rusted shut.</p>
<p>Slowly, her head turned. Not to me, but to the space <em>beside</em>
me. Her eyes, from this distance, were dark sockets. She looked at the
empty porch chair next to mine, and her lips moved. No sound reached me.
Then she looked back at the big house, turned, and melted into the
jungle. Not a walk. A withdrawal.</p>
<p>A chill, sharper than the rain, needled my spine. I fumbled with the
key, my fingers numb. The cottage door opened with a groan of
protest.</p>
<p>Inside, it was a museum of arrested time. The air was cool and
carried the ghost of lemongrass and camphor. A single room: a narrow bed
with a faded <em>kain songket</em> spread, a wooden desk, a rattan
armchair. A doorway led to a basic bathroom. On the desk sat a kerosene
lamp, a box of matches, and a sealed envelope with my name written in a
spidery, familiar hand—Grandmother’s.</p>
<p>I dropped my suitcase. The silence here was different. It wasn’t an
absence, but a presence—a held breath. I picked up the envelope, slit it
with my thumb.</p>
<p><em>Ameena</em>,</p>
<p><em>If you are reading this, you are in the kecil. Good. You were
always a practical girl. The house is yours now. What is in it, is
yours. What is with it, is yours. Do not let the trust people in until
you have walked every room. There is a ledger in the desk. Read it. The
truth is not in the deeds, but in the debts.</em></p>
<p><em>Jaga diri.</em></p>
<p><em>—Nenek</em></p>
<p>No date. No sentiment. A command. <em>Jaga diri</em>. Take care of
yourself.</p>
<p>I opened the desk drawer. Inside, next to a dried-up ink bottle and a
nib pen, lay a large, cloth-bound ledger. I lifted it out. It was
heavier than it looked. The cover was stained with damp and something
that looked like old tea. I opened it.</p>
<p>The first page was not a financial record. It was a list of names. In
two columns. The left column, in neat cursive English: <em>James P.
Whittaker, 1898. Reginald Croft, 1902. Li Feng, 1911.</em> The right
column, in precise Jawi script: <em>Hassan bin Ismail, 1898. Aisha binti
Omar, 1902. Chen Li, 1911.</em></p>
<p>Dates, but no amounts. Just names, paired like partners in a
dance.</p>
<p>I flipped a page. More names, deeper into the 20th century.
<em>Thomas Greene, 1938. Yoshida Kenji, 1943. Ahmad bin Talib,
1943.</em> The pairings continued, a relentless tally. On the page for
1957, the year of independence, the entries stopped for a decade. Then
they resumed in 1968. The last entry was in 1985. On the left:
<em>Robert T. Fletcher</em>. On the right, in Grandmother’s hand:
<em>Zahra binti Zainal</em>.</p>
<p>My mother.</p>
<p>A cold knot tightened in my stomach. My mother, who had fled this
place for Kuala Lumpur, then married my father and fled again to London,
who spoke of her childhood in brittle, broken fragments, like shards of
a vase she refused to glue back together. Who died in a silent, private
way long before the cancer took her, her voice reduced to a whisper in a
room with the curtains drawn.</p>
<p>What was this? A record of employment? Servants and masters? But the
dates were the same. Did they die together? Leave together?</p>
<p>A sound jerked my head up. A distinct, rhythmic <em>creak… creak…
creak</em>.</p>
<p>Coming from the <em>rumah besar</em>.</p>
<p>I closed the ledger, my heart a trapped bird. It was the sound of a
rocking chair on a wooden floor. Slow, patient, persistent.</p>
<p>I walked to the cottage door, looked out. The evening was drawing in,
the sky a bruised purple. The big house loomed, its silhouette a cut-out
against the fading light. Upstairs, on the verandah outside the master
bedroom, I could see it: the silhouette of a rocking chair, moving back
and forth. Empty, but moving.</p>
<p>As if someone had just stood up from it.</p>
<p>The <em>creak… creak… creak</em> continued, a metronome counting the
seconds.</p>
<p>I thought of the ledger. Of the paired names. Of my mother’s name,
the last in its column.</p>
<p><em>What is with it, is yours.</em></p>
<p>The rocking stopped. Abruptly.</p>
<p>All was silent. The jungle held its breath. The house waited.</p>
<p>I knew then I would not sleep in the cottage. The command in the note
was a current, pulling me towards the dark maw of the verandah. I was
here to inventory a house, but the house, it seemed, had already begun
inventorying me.</p>
<p>I took the kerosene lamp, lit it with a match that flared
sulphur-bright. The flame steadied, casting a wobbly globe of light. I
stepped out into the damp evening, the grass wet and clinging to my
ankles. I walked towards the <em>rumah besar</em>, the key to its front
door now a heavy, deliberate weight in my hand.</p>
<p>The front steps were broad, made of local granite, worn smooth in the
middle by generations of feet. I could feel the grooves through my thin
shoes. The double doors were towering things of dark wood, carved with a
motif of intertwining ferns and vines—local flora subsumed into a
Victorian aesthetic. The brass knocker was a gaping serpent’s head.</p>
<p>I inserted the key. It turned with a solid, oiled <em>clunk</em> that
echoed within. I pushed.</p>
<p>The door opened onto a wall of cool, still air that smelled of dust,
mildew, and the faint, clinging perfume of dried roses. My lamp light
pushed back the darkness, revealing a grand central hall. A staircase
swept up to the left. To the right, a formal sitting room, furniture
shrouded in white sheets, looking like a congregation of ghosts.
Straight ahead, French doors led to a back verandah and the drowning
green of the garden beyond.</p>
<p>But it was the walls that arrested me. They were covered, every inch,
in photographs. Hundreds, maybe thousands of them, framed in everything
from ornate silver to simple bamboo. A silent, staring crowd.</p>
<p>I stepped closer, lifting the lamp. The photographs were not arranged
chronologically, but in a chaotic mosaic. Here, a stiff colonial family
portrait from the 1920s, the white men in crisp whites, their wives in
lace, unsmiling Malay servants blurred in the background. Next to it, a
snapshot from the 1970s, my grandmother as a young woman, standing
sternly next to a grinning Australian man in a safari jacket. Here, a
Japanese officer in uniform, 1940s, seated in the very rattan chair now
shrouded in the corner. There, a group of laughing Communist insurgents
in the 1950s, rifles slung casually, on the back verandah.</p>
<p>The house had been a chameleon, its skin changing with each new
occupant. But the backdrop was constant: these rooms, this wood, this
land.</p>
<p>And in almost every photo, if you looked at the edges, in the shadows
of verandahs or doorways, there were other figures. The local faces. The
cooks, the gardeners, the nursemaids. Their names, I realized with a
jolt, were likely in the ledger. Paired. Hassan with James. Aisha with
Reginald. My mother with Robert Fletcher.</p>
<p>A sound from above. A soft <em>shuff-shuff</em>, like bare feet on
polished wood.</p>
<p>I looked up the staircase. The darkness at the top was absolute.</p>
<p>“Hello?” My voice was swallowed by the hungry silence.</p>
<p><em>Creak…</em></p>
<p>The rocking chair on the upstairs verandah had started again.</p>
<p>I had a choice: retreat to the cottage with its single lock and its
rational dimensions, or climb into the throat of the house.</p>
<p>My foot was on the first stair before I’d consciously decided. The
wood groaned a different note here, a personal complaint. The lamp light
licked the banister, revealing a patina of hand-oil from countless
palms. Whose palms? The colonist’s wife descending to dinner? The
fugitive hiding from soldiers? My mother, running down, a child late for
some lesson?</p>
<p>The <em>shuff-shuff</em> came again, from the long upstairs hallway.
I reached the landing. Doors lined the corridor, all closed. At the far
end, the door to the master bedroom stood ajar, a slice of deeper
darkness visible. The rocking sound came from the verandah beyond
it.</p>
<p>I walked forward, the floorboards whispering underfoot. I passed a
closed door, and a cold spot hit me—a pocket of air so chill it made the
lamp flame gutter. I hurried past.</p>
<p>At the master bedroom door, I paused. I pushed it open slowly.</p>
<p>The room was vast, dominated by a four-poster bed, its mosquito
netting hanging in rotted grey veils. A large <em>almari</em> wardrobe
stood against one wall, its mirror so foxed with age it gave back only a
smoky, distorted version of my lamp and my wide eyes. The rocking chair
was on the verandah, still moving.</p>
<p>I walked through the room, drawn to the motion. I stepped out onto
the verandah. The chair was empty, rocking gently as if in a breeze, but
the night air was perfectly still.</p>
<p>I reached out to stop it. My hand closed on the smooth, worn wood of
the armrest.</p>
<p>It was warm.</p>
<p>I snatched my hand back. As I did, my gaze fell on the verandah
floor. In the corner, where the wall met the floorboards, was a small,
dark mound. I knelt, bringing the lamp close.</p>
<p>They were needles. Not sewing needles. <em>Acupuncture</em> needles.
Old, tarnished silver, with delicate, twisted handles. Seven of them,
arranged in a careful, deliberate pattern on the wood. A tiny, metallic
constellation.</p>
<p>I knew this pattern. I’d seen it in a book on traditional healing. It
was for calming a restless spirit, for anchoring a wandering
<em>semangat</em>.</p>
<p>Someone had tried to pin something here.</p>
<p>A voice spoke, so close and so sudden the breath grazed my ear.</p>
<p>“<em>Jangan sentuh.</em>”</p>
<p>Don’t touch.</p>
<p>I whirled, lamp swinging wildly, casting crazed shadows. The verandah
was empty. The rocking chair had stopped. The voice had been a woman’s,
old, cracked, speaking in the old dialect. It had not been in my ear. It
had been <em>inside</em> it.</p>
<p>I stumbled back into the bedroom, my heart hammering against my ribs.
I needed to get out, back to the cottage, back to the world of
solicitors and papers and trust.</p>
<p>As I turned, the foxed mirror on the <em>almari</em> caught my
movement. In its murky depth, I saw my reflection, pale and terrified.
And behind me, not in the room, but reflected <em>in the room</em>,
sitting on the edge of the bed with her hands folded in her lap, was the
woman from the treeline. She was looking directly at me, her
ash-coloured <em>kebaya</em> stark in the gloom.</p>
<p>I spun around. The bed was empty, the rotten netting still.</p>
<p>I looked back at the mirror. She was still there, her gaze
unwavering.</p>
<p>A memory detonated, soundless and bright: myself, maybe five years
old, hiding under this very bed. The smell of dust and kapok. The sound
of my mother weeping. And a pair of feet, in delicate <em>kasut
manek</em> beaded shoes, standing motionless by the bedroom door.
Waiting.</p>
<p>The woman in the mirror slowly raised one hand and pointed. Not at
me. At the <em>almari</em> behind my reflection.</p>
<p>Then she faded, like smoke dissolving in water.</p>
<p>Trembling, I turned to the real <em>almari</em>. I walked to it,
gripped the brass handles, and pulled. The doors stuck, then gave with a
shriek of protest.</p>
<p>Inside, hanging on a rail, was a single garment. A <em>kebaya</em>.
Ash-coloured, high-necked. The very one.</p>
<p>And on the shelf below it, neatly stacked, were seven leather-bound
journals. A date was tooled on the spine of the top one:
<em>1979-1985</em>.</p>
<p>My mother’s handwriting.</p>
<p>The house exhaled around me, a long, slow release of held breath. It
had shown me the first piece. The ledger of debts. The needles of
containment. The ghost in the mirror. My mother’s hidden voice.</p>
<p>I took the first journal. I did not retreat to the cottage. I sat on
the floor of the master bedroom, my back against the post of the bed
where a ghost had sat, and I opened it to the first page.</p>
<p>The first line, in my mother’s looping script, read:</p>
<p><em>“Robert says the house is quiet. Robert is a fool. The house is
never quiet. It is listening.”</em></p>
<p>Outside, the rain began again, a soft, insistent whisper against the
leaves. The house was eating it. And I, inside its belly, began to
read.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-2-1">CHAPTER 2</h2>
<p>My mother’s words were a key that didn’t turn a lock, but dissolved
it.</p>
<p><em>October 12, 1979. He wants to call it a restoration. A
preservation of colonial heritage. He talks of exposed beams and
“authentic period fittings.” He does not hear the beams talking at
night. They speak in Malay, a low, granular gossip. He sanded the floor
in the east room yesterday and the sawdust smelled of cloves and grief.
I told him. He laughed and kissed my forehead, called me his “little
superstitious sprite.” The taste of his laughter was like copper on my
tongue.</em></p>
<p>I read until the kerosene lamp began to gutter, the world shrinking
to the pool of light on the aged paper. Zahra was 22 in these early
entries, recently married to Robert Fletcher, the dashing, older British
ex-diplomat who had “saved” the house from ruin. He was her passport out
of her mother’s stern, silent dominion, or so she thought. Instead, he’d
brought her back to its epicentre.</p>
<p>Her words were not the fragile, whispering mother I knew. They were
sharp, observant, and laced with a corrosive irony. She saw the house as
a living, recording organism. Robert saw it as a project.</p>
<p>A noise from downstairs—a distinct, single <em>tap</em> on
wood—jolted me from 1979. The lamp flame dipped. The darkness in the
hallway felt solid, attentive.</p>
<p>I stood, joints stiff, the journal clutched to my chest. It was past
midnight. The rain had stopped, leaving a dripping, echoing aftermath. I
needed sleep, but the thought of the cottage felt like a retreat, a
failure to understand the terms of my inheritance. The house had issued
a challenge in the form of a ledger and a ghost. My mother had answered
with a secret chronicle. To leave now would be to insult them both.</p>
<p>I took the journal and the lamp and went downstairs. The photographs
watched my descent. In the kitchen—a later addition, a utilitarian space
of chipped tiles and a monstrous old iron stove—I found a tin of tea and
a pot. The water from the tap ran rust-brown for a full minute before
clearing. I boiled it on a small gas ring, the blue flame a tiny, modern
defiance against the house’s deep time.</p>
<p>Seated at the heavy kitchen table, the journal open beside my chipped
mug, I read on.</p>
<p><em>March 3, 1980. The </em>bomoh* came today. Old Man Hassan from
the village. Robert was in town, buying more varnish. Hassan didn’t come
to the front door. He stood at the edge of the jungle, where the big
<em>ara</em> tree is. I knew why he was there. I took him a glass of
syrup water. He didn’t drink it. He looked at the house, his eyes milky
with cataracts, and said, “This house is a ledger. Every master writes
his name in blood and light. Every servant writes their name in shadow
and bone. The pages are full, <em>cucu</em>. But the pen is still in
hand.” He left without another word. I found seven <em>jarum</em>
needles on the back step after. I keep them.*</p>
<p>The needles. The ones on the verandah. They weren’t a containment.
They were an offering. A tool left for her.</p>
<p>The next entries detailed Robert’s work. The uncovering of a brick
fireplace. The discovery of a hidden compartment in the study containing
yellowed maps. Zahra’s growing isolation. Robert’s friends—other expats,
local businessmen—their loud, laughing dinners on the verandah where she
was a decorative, silent fixture.</p>
<p><em>August 15, 1981. He found the diaries in the attic. Not mine.
Older ones. A British planter’s wife, from the 1890s. He read them aloud
for amusement after dinner, her prissy complaints about the heat and the
“sullen” help. Everyone laughed. I looked at the photograph on the
wall—the one of that woman with her Malay nursemaid, a girl my age,
their names in the ledger: Eleanor Winthrop and Aisha. The nursemaid’s
eyes were not sullen. They were dead. Robert doesn’t see that. He only
sees stories. He doesn’t hear the debt.</em></p>
<p>A debt. The word tolled through me. I thought of the paired names.
Not employer-employee. Creditor-debtor. But what was the currency?</p>
<p>A gust of wind rattled the kitchen shutters. Not the warm, wet jungle
wind. A cold, dry slip of air that coiled around my ankles. The lamp
flame stretched sideways, then snapped back upright.</p>
<p><em>Tap.</em></p>
<p>There it was again. From the direction of the study.</p>
<p>I stood, the chair scraping loud in the silence. I picked up the
lamp. The hallway was a tunnel of darkness. The study door was
half-open. Robert Fletcher’s domain, preserved like a museum. I pushed
the door wider.</p>
<p>The room was a monument to colonial nostalgia. A large teak desk.
Bookshelves filled with leather-bound volumes on Malayan history and
botany. A framed photograph of a younger Robert and Zahra on their
wedding day, standing right here on the front lawn. She was a beautiful,
solemn doll in a white <em>kebaya</em>. He was beaming, possessive.</p>
<p><em>Tap.</em></p>
<p>It came from the desk. I approached. On the green leather blotter lay
a fountain pen, a handsome, heavy thing. As I watched, the pen, of its
own accord, <em>tapped</em> once on the blotter. Then was still.</p>
<p>Not a roll. A deliberate, vertical tap.</p>
<p>My skin prickled. I remembered a story my mother told me once, during
a rare, lucid moment. A fairy tale, she’d called it. About a
<em>penanggalan</em>, a detached female head that flew searching for
vengeance. But that wasn’t right. This was different. This was not a
monster, but a message. A punctuation.</p>
<p>I looked at the bookshelf behind the desk. One volume was jutting out
slightly. I pulled it. It was a hollowed-out book, a hiding place.
Inside was a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. I unfolded the cloth.</p>
<p>It contained a pair of <em>kerongsang</em>, the traditional brooches
for a <em>kebaya</em>. They were exquisite: silver filigree set with
tiny, flawed rubies. And a faded black-and-white photograph of a young
Malay woman, beautiful and unsmiling, wearing the very same brooches on
an ash-grey <em>kebaya</em>. On the back, in flowing Jawi: <em>For my
daughter, Zahra. May you see clearly. —Khalijah</em></p>
<p>Khalijah. My great-grandmother. The woman in the mirror.</p>
<p>The pen tapped again, twice, insistently.</p>
<p>I looked at it, then at the hollow book, the brooches, the
photograph. “What?” I whispered, my voice raw. “What do you want me to
see?”</p>
<p>A floorboard creaked heavily in the hall. Not the normal settling of
an old house. This was the weight of a step.</p>
<p>I blew out the lamp.</p>
<p>Darkness, absolute and velvety, swallowed the room. The smell of old
paper and dust intensified. I crouched behind the desk, my breath loud
in my ears. The brooches were cold in my fist.</p>
<p>The footsteps entered the study. Slow, deliberate. Not the barefoot
<em>shuff-shuff</em> from upstairs. This was the solid, measured tread
of shoes on wood. A man’s walk.</p>
<p>He stopped in the centre of the room. I could feel a presence, a
displacement of air. A smell arrived with him: pipe tobacco, bay rum,
and underneath, the faint, sweet smell of decayed orchids.</p>
<p>Robert Fletcher.</p>
<p>I held my breath. This was not a visual ghost. This was a sensory
one, an imprint of habit and personality.</p>
<p>I heard the rustle of paper. The squeak of his desk chair as weight
settled into it. A sigh, long and weary. Then, the distinct
<em>scratch-scratch</em> of a pen on paper. Writing in the dark.</p>
<p>He wrote for what felt like minutes. Then the chair squeaked again.
The footsteps walked to the bookshelf. I heard the slide of a book being
pushed back into place. My book. The hollow one.</p>
<p>The footsteps walked to the door, paused. A low, muttered sentence,
spoken in plummy, frustrated English: “…can’t reason with it. Like the
whole damned country.”</p>
<p>Then he was gone. The footsteps receded down the hall.</p>
<p>I waited until the silence returned to its baseline hum before I
relit the lamp. My hands shook. On the desk blotter, where there had
been nothing, now lay a single sheet of heavy cream paper. On it, in
fresh, dark ink that gleamed in the lamplight, was a list.</p>
<p><em>Winthrop – Aisha (1898)</em> <em>Croft – Hassan (1902)</em>
<em>Yoshida – Ahmad (1943)</em></p>
<p>It was a subset from the ledger. And at the bottom, in the same hand,
was a new pairing, the ink slightly smudged as if written in
agitation:</p>
<p><em>Fletcher – Z. (1985)</em></p>
<p>Followed by a question mark.</p>
<p>And beneath that, a single, underlined word: <em>Settlement?</em></p>
<p>The debt. He was aware of it. He was trying to settle it. With my
mother.</p>
<p>I took the paper, the brooches, the photograph. I fled the study, not
for the cottage, but upstairs, back to the master bedroom. It felt,
perversely, like the only place of clarity. I barricaded the door with a
chair under the knob, a futile, childish gesture.</p>
<p>Dawn was a grey smear at the window when I opened my mother’s journal
again, searching for 1985.</p>
<p>The entries grew sparser, the handwriting more erratic.</p>
<p><em>April 19, 1985. He knows I’ve seen the ledger. He tried to
explain it as a historical curiosity, a record of “partnerships.” He
said every great house here has one. A balance. He said Khalijah started
it, that she believed in the balance. He said we are part of the
tradition now. He calls it “being part of the fabric of the place.” The
fabric is stained. I am not a thread. I am a spot.</em></p>
<p><em>May 3, 1985. He has been in the attic for two days. He brings
down boxes. Old account books. He mutters about “terms” and
“fulfilment.” He looks at me differently. Not with love. With
calculation. Khalijah watches from the mirror. She does not
blink.</em></p>
<p><em>July 1, 1985. He has made the offer. The settlement. He says it
will free us. Free the house. He says it is what Khalijah wants. What
all the women of this house have done. It is a tradition of strength, he
says. Not subservience. A partnership. He showed me the photograph of
Aisha and Eleanor Winthrop. “See?” he said. “They understood.” Aisha’s
dead eyes understood nothing. I told him no.</em></p>
<p>The final entry was dated three weeks later.</p>
<p><em>July 22, 1985. The </em>bomoh<em>, Hassan, is dead. The needles
are gone from my drawer. Robert is calm. Too calm. He has taken the
ledger to his study. He says we will talk tomorrow. Khalijah is in the
mirror every night now. She points to the </em>almari<em>. Inside, I
found this </em>kebaya<em>. She wants me to wear it. For the settlement.
I am so tired. The house is listening. It agrees with him.</em></p>
<p>The journal ended.</p>
<p>There were no more.</p>
<p>Zahra binti Zainal, 1985. The last entry on the ledger’s right
column.</p>
<p>What was the settlement? What had Robert Fletcher proposed? And what
had happened after she refused?</p>
<p>I knew what happened after. My mother left. She fled to Kuala Lumpur,
met my father, a gentle academic, and left the country. She had me. She
locked herself away, piece by piece, until she was a ghost in a London
flat.</p>
<p>The house had claimed its debt anyway.</p>
<p>Sunlight, weak and watery, now filtered through the dirty windows.
The night’s horrors receded, not vanishing, but hardening into facts.
The ledger. The ghosts. The settlement.</p>
<p>I got up, removed the chair from the door. The morning birds were
shrieking in the jungle. Normalcy was a performance outside.</p>
<p>I needed to find out what Robert Fletcher had discovered in the
attic. I needed to understand the terms of the debt.</p>
<p>And I needed to know why, of all the paired names, only the women of
my family—Khalijah, Zahra—were remembered as ghosts in the fabric of the
house, while the others were just names in a book.</p>
<p>I walked to the mirror. My own face looked back, hollow-eyed, older.
I held up the <em>kerongsang</em> brooches, clicking them together. They
made a sound like tiny bones.</p>
<p>“Khalijah,” I said to the glass. “I’m listening.”</p>
<p>In the reflection, just for a second, the ash-grey <em>kebaya</em>
hung not in the <em>almari</em> behind me, but on my own shoulders. Then
it was gone.</p>
<p>The house had its next Zainal woman. The ledger was open. The pen was
in hand.</p>
<p>I had six days before the trust arrived. Six days to settle an
account forty years overdue.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-3-1">CHAPTER 3</h2>
<p>The attic was a breath held for a century.</p>
<p>The pull-cord for the hatch was in the upstairs hallway ceiling,
disguised as a part of the floral moulding. I found it only because a
line of cleaner plaster betrayed its outline. I tugged. With a groan of
springs, a ladder unfolded, wooden slats clattering down, releasing a
cascade of dust that glittered in the morning light.</p>
<p>The air that descended was hot, dry, and tasted of memory—of dried
papaya leaves, camphor, and the faint, metallic tang of rust.</p>
<p>I climbed, the journal and a flashlight in my pocket, the brooches
pinned to my shirt, a foolish talisman.</p>
<p>The space was larger than I expected, running the length of the
house. The roof was supported by massive, rough-hewn beams—the bones of
the house, naked. In the triangular gloom, stacked trunks, discarded
furniture, and mounds of sheet-shrouded shapes created a labyrinth.</p>
<p>Robert Fletcher had been here. A path was cleared through the dust,
leading to the far end. I followed it, my flashlight beam cutting a
swath through the motes.</p>
<p>He had created a workspace. A folding camp table held a hurricane
lamp, a canteen, and a neat stack of papers weighted down by a geode.
Around it were open trunks, their contents spilled onto the floor:
ledgers older than the one in my cottage, bundles of letters tied with
faded ribbon, photograph albums, and rolled maps.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been preserving history. He’d been conducting an audit.</p>
<p>I sat in his folding chair, the canvas creaking. The top paper on the
stack was a typed list, titled <em>“Cross-Reference: Ledger Pairs &amp;
Property Transactions.”</em> My heart thudded dully. I scanned it.</p>
<p><em>Whittaker/Hassan (1898): Transfer of 5 acres northern rubber plot
to Hassan family trust, recorded as “gratuity.”</em> <em>Croft/Aisha
(1902): Forfeiture of Croft’s Klang warehouse shares to Aisha’s
next-of-kin, posthumous.</em> <em>Yoshida/Ahmad (1943): Grant of
Yoshida’s personal vehicle and fuel ration papers to Ahmad’s family.
(Note: Yoshida reported missing/killed by resistance, same
week.)</em></p>
<p>Each pair was followed by a transaction. A transfer of wealth,
property, or goods from the left column to the right, occurring at or
near the date of pairing. It was systematic. The “debt” was being paid.
But paid for what?</p>
<p>I dug deeper. Under the typed list were handwritten notes on
foolscap, in Robert’s aggressive script.</p>
<p><em>“Hypothesis: Not superstition. A pact. A </em>perjanjian<em>.
Master provides protection, status, capital. Servant provides…
continuity. Anchor. Legitimacy. The house is the constant. The master is
transient. The servant is the root. The root must be fed, or the house
becomes… unstable. (See incidents: 1911 fever, 1943 fire, 1968
collapse.)”</em></p>
<p><em>“Khalijah Zainal (b. 1910) understood this. Instituted the modern
ledger. Not a record of service, but of contract. My pairing with Zahra
(1985) is the latest iteration. But she refuses the settlement. The
balance is upset. Manifestations increase.”</em></p>
<p>A cold clarity was forming. This wasn’t about haunting. It was about
ecology. The house was a system. The colonial master, the Japanese
occupier, the post-independence owner—they were all invasive species,
temporary blooms. The local line—the servants, the caretakers, the
<em>root</em>—was the perennial. For the house to thrive, for the
invasive species to survive within it, a nutrient transfer was required.
A tithe. A <em>settlement</em>.</p>
<p>And the women of my family were the stewards of this transaction.
Khalijah had been the last to fully understand it, to enforce it. She
had paired my mother with Robert, expecting Zahra to assume the role. To
broker his “settlement” with the house, with the past.</p>
<p>But my mother had said no. She had rejected the pact, the gothic
ecology of the place. And she had fled, leaving the debt unpaid, the
balance sheet bleeding red ink for forty years.</p>
<p>Which was why the house was so hungry. Why Khalijah’s ghost was so
present. Why it had called me back.</p>
<p>I was the inheritor of the debt.</p>
<p>A rustle came from behind a stack of trunks. Not rats. Something
softer. A sigh of fabric.</p>
<p>I stood, flashlight beam spearing the gloom. “Hello?”</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I walked around the stack. There, in a cleared space against the
slope of the roof, was a child’s nursery. A small wrought-iron crib, a
rocking horse with its paint flayed, a tiny, mildewed chair. And on the
floor, a pattern was laid out: not needles this time, but old, carved
wooden alphabet blocks. They were arranged to spell two words.</p>
<p><strong>Z A H R A</strong> <strong>B A Y I</strong></p>
<p><em>Baby.</em></p>
<p>My mother was pregnant. In 1985. She never spoke of a pregnancy
before me. I was born in London, in 1996.</p>
<p>A lost child. A sibling I never had.</p>
<p>The air in the attic grew dense, cold. The blocks trembled, then
rearranged themselves, as if invisible fingers were pushing them.</p>
<p><strong>B A Y I H I L A N G</strong></p>
<p><em>Lost baby.</em></p>
<p>Then:</p>
<p><strong>S E T T L E M E N T</strong></p>
<p>The blocks scattered, clattering across the floorboards.</p>
<p>The settlement wasn’t just about money or land. Robert’s offer, the
tradition Khalijah upheld… it involved a child. A sacrifice? An offering
to the house? To the ledger?</p>
<p>My stomach turned to ice. I stumbled back to the table, my hands
scrabbling through Robert’s notes. I found a thinner sheaf, clipped
together. It was correspondence. Carbon copies of letters from Robert to
a firm in Singapore, dated mid-1985.</p>
<p><em>“…regarding the adoption proceedings. Discretion is paramount.
The child would be raised in excellent circumstances, a private
arrangement, a fresh start. The mother is agreeable in principle but
requires… reassurance on the permanence of the separation.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…the historical precedent is clear. In cases of imbalance, a
fostering of the line ensures continuity. The Winthrop child, 1899. The
Croft girl, 1903. It is not an abandonment, but a redistribution. A
balancing of the account.”</em></p>
<p>My legs gave way. I sank into the chair.</p>
<p>It was about children. The “settlement” for the women of the root,
the payment for their anchoring service, was not just material. It was
their firstborn children. Given to the masters to raise, to “foster,” to
sever from the local line and graft onto the colonial one. A permanent,
living transfer of legacy. The ultimate debt payment.</p>
<p>Khalijah had given up a child. To the Crofts? To the Yoshidas? The
ledger pairs took on a new, horrific dimension.</p>
<p>Robert, following the “precedent,” had expected Zahra to give up her
child—my lost sibling—to him. To be raised as a Fletcher. To settle his
account with the house.</p>
<p>She had refused. She had fled, carrying the debt, and the lost child,
with her.</p>
<p>The attic seemed to press in on me. The heat was suffocating. I
needed air. I grabbed the most damning letters and stumbled towards the
ladder.</p>
<p>As I passed the nursery space, I saw the blocks had been rearranged
one final time.</p>
<p><strong>A M E E N A</strong></p>
<p>My name.</p>
<p>Then, a single block had been placed apart, like a full stop.</p>
<p><strong>V</strong></p>
<p>Five. The fifth generation.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-4-1">CHAPTER 4</h2>
<p>The rain had stopped, but the house was still drinking. I could feel
it in the silence, a deep, thirsty pull on the damp air. The monsoon
left everything gleaming and heavy, the garden a stew of shadows and the
wet, green smell of things growing against their will.</p>
<p>I sat on the porch steps of the caretaker’s cottage, the carbon
copies of Robert’s letters a damp weight in my lap. The words had bled a
little in the humidity, the typewritten letters softening into ghosts.
<em>Discretion is paramount. A fresh start. A balancing of the
account.</em> They were not papers anymore; they were bones. The
fossilised remains of a choice my mother had made, a choice that had
carved the hollow space where a sibling should have been, that had sent
her running into a life she never described.</p>
<p>Khalijah found me there. She moved without sound, a part of the
dripping garden. She held two tin mugs, steam curling from them in the
bruised light.</p>
<p>“You did not sleep,” she said. It wasn’t a question. She handed me a
mug. The coffee was thick, bitter, sweetened with condensed milk. A
taste of here. A taste of then.</p>
<p>“I found the letters,” I said. My voice was rust. “About the
children.”</p>
<p>She lowered herself onto the step beside me, her movements careful,
each one a settled decision. She looked at the <em>rumah besar</em>. Its
windows were dark eyes, watching us back.</p>
<p>“It was the deepest thread,” she said, her voice low. “The first
debt. The land, the labour, the blood… these could be counted, could be
paid with coin or sweat. But the future? The line? That is a different
arithmetic. To take a child is to take a root and plant it in another
soil. It changes the shape of the family tree. It is a permanent
settlement.”</p>
<p>“You gave up a child.” The words felt too sharp, too loud for the
swallowing air.</p>
<p>Khalijah took a slow sip. “His name was Arif. He had his father’s
smile, but my mother’s eyes. The eyes that see the <em>penunggu</em> in
the trees.” She was quiet for a long time. The house sighed, a timber
groaning in its wet sleep. “Mr. Yoshida was not a cruel man. He was a
sad man. His wife could not have children. He saw it as a kindness, a
promotion. My boy would want for nothing. He would go to school in
Singapore. He would have a name that opened doors.”</p>
<p>“And you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I had a new roof. Money sent to my mother’s village. And a hole.”
She tapped her chest, just below the collarbone. “A hole that never
closes. It is a specific kind of silence, Amena. The silence of a name
you cannot call. You learn to breathe around it.”</p>
<p>I thought of my mother’s silence. The stories she never told, the
father she never named, the brother or sister she never mentioned. Had
she carried the same hole? Had she looked at me, sometimes, and seen the
ghost of the other child she’d saved by running?</p>
<p>“Robert wanted her to do the same,” I said.</p>
<p>“He was a man of the ledger. He saw precedent. He saw balance. To
him, it was the next entry in a column. To Zahra…” Khalijah shook her
head, a faint, proud smile touching her lips. “Your mother was fire
where I was water. She would not be entered into any book. She took the
debt onto her own head and she walked out of its shadow. A dangerous
thing to do. An unpaid debt to this place… it does not fade. It grows
interest.”</p>
<p>“The fifth generation,” I whispered, seeing the lone block in the
attic dust. <strong>V</strong>.</p>
<p>Khalijah followed my gaze to the big house. “The house is hungry. It
has been fed a certain way for a long time. It expects a settlement.
Robert is gone. Zahra is gone. The debt is awake. And you are here.” She
turned to me, her eyes holding the same knowing darkness as the
<em>belian</em> wood. “You must finish it. One way or another.”</p>
<p>“How?” The word was a plea.</p>
<p>“You must go into the heart of it. You must read the oldest ledger.
The one that began it all. Not Robert’s copies. Not the echoes. The
source.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“There is a room,” she said. “Below the house. A strong room.
Mr. Croft built it to hold his most important papers, his gold, his…
agreements. It is where the first ledger is kept. It is where the root
was first anchored.”</p>
<p>The air seemed to grow colder. The strong room. The inmost cave.</p>
<p>“I can’t go in there alone,” I said, and it was the truest thing I’d
said since I arrived.</p>
<p>Khalijah placed her hand over mine. Her skin was cool, papery,
strong. “You will not. I have called someone.”</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>He arrived as the afternoon sun bled through the canopy, a tall man
in a faded forestry department jacket, moving with the loose-limbed
grace of someone who knows the ground beneath him. Razak. Khalijah’s
nephew. His face was solemn, etched with a quiet patience, and he
carried a canvas satchel that clinked softly with tools.</p>
<p>“The locks are old,” Razak said, his English precise, educated.
“European mechanisms, but rusted. The wood around them will be harder
than the metal.” He looked at me, his assessment quick, thorough. “You
are sure?”</p>
<p>“I need to see it,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded, as if that was answer enough. “Then we go at dusk. The
light will be wrong. The house… pays less attention.”</p>
<p>The preparation was a ritual. Khalijah boiled rice and wrapped it in
banana leaf with salted fish, a meal for a journey. Razak laid out his
tools on the cottage floor: a pry bar, its end worn smooth; a heavy
mallet; two oil lanterns, their glass chimneys sooty; a bottle of dark,
viscous lubricant. He checked each item with a reverent focus, as if
arming for a hunt.</p>
<p>I changed into sturdy trousers and a long-sleeved shirt, my skin
already prickling with anticipatory sweat. I gathered my own tools: the
key from the solicitor, the damning letters, my phone—useless here, a
dead slab of a world that didn’t matter. Finally, I picked up the small,
carved wooden <em>garuda</em> from my mother’s box. Its wings were
chipped, but its fierce beak was still raised. A talisman against
nothing. A piece of her.</p>
<p>We ate in silence on the porch. The food was pungent, fortifying. The
house watched us, its silhouette deepening against the lavender sky.</p>
<p>“The entrance is from outside,” Razak explained, drawing lines in the
condensation on the table. “At the back, where the foundation meets the
hill. There is a grate, then a door. It will be buried under vines and
<em>pakis</em>. The lock will be here.” He tapped a spot on his drawing.
“If it does not yield, we must persuade the wood.”</p>
<p>“And if someone is there?” I asked. “Robert’s people?”</p>
<p>Razak and Khalijah exchanged a glance. “They are clerks,” Khalijah
said. “They come in the day. They tally the visible things. They do not
go into the earth at dusk. They feel the hunger, but they do not know
its teeth.”</p>
<p>The simplicity of her statement was more chilling than any complex
threat. They were clerks. We were going to the vault.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The journey to the back of the house was a descent into the garden’s
forgotten throat. We did not take the gravel path, but slipped behind
the cottage, into the fringe of jungle that pressed against the cleared
land. Razak led, moving with an uncanny silence, parting curtains of
spider’s web and giant fern with the pry bar. Khalijah followed, a
steady, small presence at my back.</p>
<p>The air changed. It grew denser, cooler, smelling of decay and the
cold sweat of stone. The sounds of the evening—cicadas, the distant cry
of a nightjar—became muffled, as if heard through felt. We were moving
not just through space, but through layers of time. The ornamental
garden gave way to wilder growth: ancient, twisted frangipani trees with
skeletal limbs, clumps of bamboo that rattled like bones in the faint
breeze.</p>
<p>My mind was a ledger of its own, filled with the terrible arithmetic
of children. <em>The Winthrop child, 1899. The Croft girl, 1903.</em>
Names without faces. Lives redirected, roots severed. Was my mother’s
refusal the reason for the house’s current hunger? Was the blocked
chimney, the weeping walls, the rearranging blocks, a demand for a debt
deferred? Or was it something else—a final chance to break the column,
to write a zero in the balance sheet?</p>
<p>We reached the back of the <em>rumah besar</em>. Here, the hill rose
steeply, a dark mound covered in a mat of creeping <em>senduduk</em> and
elephant ear ferns. The foundation was massive blocks of laterite stone,
stained a deep, bloody orange by centuries of damp. The jungle had
embraced it fully, weaving a living wall of green.</p>
<p>Razak paused, his eyes scanning. He pointed without a word. A darker
patch in the green, a rectangular hint of order amidst the chaos. We
pushed forward, the ferns soaking our clothes with cold dew.</p>
<p>The grate was there, iron bars thick with rust and cloaked in a
flowering creeper with tiny, star-shaped blooms. It was set into the
foundation, about three feet square. Beyond it, blackness.</p>
<p>Razak handed me a lantern. “Light it when I am through,” he
whispered. He set to work with quiet efficiency, using the mallet to
knock the vine’s main stem away, then applying the lubricant to the
grate’s hinges with a slender spout. The smell of the oil, sharp and
chemical, cut through the organic rot.</p>
<p>He braced the pry bar. The first push was a protest of metal so
profound it seemed to come from the earth itself. The house above us
felt suddenly more present, a sleeping weight we were tickling with a
sharp tool. Razak strained, the muscles in his neck cording. With a
shriek that set my teeth on edge, the grate swung outward a few inches.
A breath of air sighed from the darkness within—cold, still, and
carrying a scent I knew from the attic. Dust, yes. But also the faint,
sweet-rot of champaca, and beneath it, the smell of old paper and slow,
dry decay.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Razak widened the gap enough to slip through. I lit the lanterns. The
flame was a shock of life, throwing our huge, leaping shadows against
the stone and the hungry green. Khalijah remained outside, a sentinel at
the grate.</p>
<p>“I will keep the way open,” she said. Her face in the lantern light
was carved wood, her eyes reflecting the flame. “You go to the source.
You read the first words. Then you will know the shape of the debt.”</p>
<p>I ducked and followed Razak into the belly of the hill.</p>
<p>The passage was a tunnel, shored up with the same laterite blocks. It
was narrow, forcing us to walk single file, our shoulders brushing the
cold, sweating stone. The lantern light jumped and fluttered, showing a
floor of packed earth, the ceiling hung with roots like pale, groping
nerves. The air was a constant temperature, a cellar chill that seeped
into my bones. The sound of our breathing was loud, swallowed by the
earth a few feet ahead.</p>
<p>We walked for what felt like years, but could only have been minutes.
The tunnel began to slope gently downward. The sense of descent was
profound, a sinking away from the world of light and rain and living
things.</p>
<p>“There,” Razak breathed.</p>
<p>A door. It was made of <em>belian</em>, the same ironwood as the
house above, but here, untouched by sun or rain, it was a pure, deep
black. It was banded with iron, and in its centre was a lock, a heavy,
ornate thing of tarnished brass and blackened steel. It looked less like
a lock and more like a sigil, a complex knot meant to bind something
within.</p>
<p>Razak examined it, running a finger over the mechanism. He shook his
head. “Not rust. It is… sealed. A different kind of corrosion.” He tried
the key from the solicitor. It fit, but would not turn. It was the wrong
key for this door. This was a door that required a different kind of
permission.</p>
<p>He looked at me, then at the lock. “Sometimes,” he said softly, “the
way is not through the mechanism, but around it. The wood is strong, but
the frame is stone.” He pointed to the hinges, massive iron plates set
directly into the laterite. “They will be the weakest point. They bear
all the weight.”</p>
<p>He set to work with the mallet and pry bar, not on the lock, but on
the stone at the top hinge. The strikes were careful, precise, each one
a sharp, ringing <em>tok</em> that travelled up the tunnel and seemed to
be absorbed by the house far above. Chips of ancient mortar dusted the
floor. I held the lanterns steady, my heart hammering against my ribs.
Each strike felt like a violation, an alarm we were ringing in the deep
places.</p>
<p>With a final, grating crunch, the top hinge pulled free from the
crumbling stone. The door sagged. Razak moved to the bottom hinge. The
work was faster now. The mallet struck, and with a groan of tormented
iron, the bottom pin sheared.</p>
<p>The door did not fall. It leaned, a black tooth loose in a stone gum.
Razak wedged the pry bar into the gap and leaned his full weight. The
sound was a long, deep exhalation, the sound of a chest collapsing. The
door swung inward, and the air that rushed out was so still, so ancient,
it felt solid.</p>
<p>We raised the lanterns.</p>
<p>The strong room was small, perhaps ten feet square. The walls were
bare stone. In the centre stood a single, massive table of
<em>belian</em>, its legs thick as tree trunks. And on the table, laid
out with a formality that froze my blood, were three things.</p>
<p>On the left, a stack of gold ingots, dull and heavy in the light.</p>
<p>On the right, a leather-bound ledger, far older than Robert’s, its
cover cracked and dry.</p>
<p>And in the centre, resting on a square of faded crimson velvet, was a
small, intricately carved wooden box.</p>
<p>But it was the walls that stopped my breath. They were not bare
stone. They were covered, from floor to ceiling, in writing. Not
printed, not typed. Handwritten. Names, dates, amounts. In English, in
Dutch, in flowing Jawi script. They climbed over each other, a dense,
desperate tapestry of ink that had in some places faded to ghostly
brown, in others seeped into the stone like a stain. It was the ledger,
made manifest. The very skin of the debt.</p>
<p>Razak hung back at the threshold, as if the room had a forcefield. “I
will wait here,” he said, his voice hushed. “This is for you to
read.”</p>
<p>I stepped inside. The silence was absolute, a vacuum. My footsteps
were muffled by the thick dust on the floor. I went to the table, my
eyes drawn first to the old ledger. I opened it with trembling hands.
The first page was vellum, the ink a faded iron gall black.</p>
<p><em>Journal of Holdings &amp; Settlements, commenced this 12th day of
April, in the Year of Our Lord 1788, by Josiah Croft, of the Honourable
East India Company.</em></p>
<p>The entries began simply. Quantities of pepper, of tin. Payments to
local chiefs for land rights. Then, the names started appearing. <em>For
securing the cooperation of Panglima Ali, a gift of one rifle and two
bottles of gin.</em> Then, more personal. <em>For services of the woman,
Mai, a monthly allowance of rice and cloth. Her dwelling built on the
north quarter.</em> The language was cold, precise.</p>
<p>I turned the pages. The entries grew longer, more intricate. Debts
forgiven for political favour. Debts incurred for “pacification” of
troublesome neighbours. And then, in 1801, an entry that made my skin
crawl:</p>
<p><em>Settlement of the outstanding account with Encek Kamal, for the
loss of his fishing grounds to the new wharf. He refuses coin. Agreement
reached for the fostering of his second son, Amin, to be educated in my
household and entered into Company service. The line is settled. The
land is quiet.</em></p>
<p>The “fostering.” Here it was, the first seed. I traced the entries
down the years. A daughter taken to wet-nurse a Croft baby who did not
thrive. A son given as a “companion” to a sickly heir. Each time, the
language was the same: <em>fostering, agreement, settlement, the line is
balanced.</em></p>
<p>It was a genealogy of theft. A family tree built not on love, but on
leverage.</p>
<p>I looked up at the whispering walls. In the flickering light, the
names seemed to shift. I walked closer, raising my lantern. Here, in a
corner, was a cluster of Jawi script, the writing hurried, desperate. I
could not read it, but I could feel its plea. Next to it, in a neat,
copperplate hand, was the translation: <em>Debt of Body, of Siti, paid
in full, 1899.</em> And a name: <em>Eleanor Winthrop.</em></p>
<p>My gaze swept the room. The entries were not just by the masters.
Here and there, in different hands, were notes, additions, corrections.
A woman named Linah had written <em>LIES</em> in bold letters next to an
entry about her “voluntary service.” Someone else had scrawled <em>BLOOD
MONEY</em> in angry red ink (was it ink?) next to a gold transaction
from 1922.</p>
<p>This room was not just a record. It was a conversation. A screaming
argument across centuries between the accountants and the accounted-for.
The house’s hunger was not just for settlement, but for this
<em>noise</em>, this eternal, unresolved conflict. It fed on the
imbalance.</p>
<p>My eyes fell on the wooden box in the centre of the table. It was
beautiful, carved with motifs of intertwining vines and closed buds. It
looked Malay, not European. A local thing placed at the heart of the
colonial record.</p>
<p>I reached for it. The wood was warm, unlike the cold stone and metal
around it. There was no lock. I lifted the lid.</p>
<p>Inside, on a bed of now-crumbled kapok, were tokens. A child’s silver
bangle, tiny and tarnished. A lock of dark hair tied with a blue thread.
A single river-smoothed stone. A dried champaca flower, brittle as
parchment. A tiny, woven <em>ketupat</em> charm. Dozens of them. Each
one a placeholder for a life redirected, a love severed. The Foster Box.
This was where they kept the echoes of the children, the physical poetry
of their loss. The human interest on the debt.</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the box, separate, resting on a folded piece of
cloth, was a final item.</p>
<p>A photograph.</p>
<p>Black and white, curling at the edges. It showed two young women
sitting on the porch of the caretaker’s cottage, smiling. One was
Khalijah, her hair long, her face unlined. The other was my mother.
Zahra. She looked so young, so fierce, her arm slung around Khalijah’s
shoulders. They were both looking at something out of frame,
laughing.</p>
<p>And tucked into the corner of the photograph, held in place by its
own weight, was a simple gold wedding band.</p>
<p>I picked it up. It was light, worn thin. Inside the band, an
inscription was engraved, so faint I had to tilt it to the lantern
light.</p>
<p><em>Z &amp; R. 1985.</em></p>
<p>My breath left me in a rush. Z &amp; R. Zahra and Robert. 1985. The
year before I was born. The year of the letters, of the “adoption
proceedings.”</p>
<p>This was not a token of a lost child. This was a token of a union. A
secret one. A forbidden one. My mother and Robert Fletcher. Not just a
master and an anchor. Something more. Something that changed the ledger
entirely.</p>
<p>If they were married, even in secret, then any child…</p>
<p>The ledger’s logic shifted, cracked open. A child of a master and an
anchor would not be a settlement to be transferred. It would be an heir.
A fusion of both lines. It would be the living, breathing balance. Not a
payment, but a resolution.</p>
<p>She hadn’t just refused to give up a child. She had refused to give
up <em>their</em> child. <em>Their</em> heir. Robert, bound by the cold
precedent of the ledger, had seen only the old pattern: take the child
to settle the debt. He hadn’t seen, or hadn’t dared to believe, that the
child itself <em>was</em> the settlement. The final entry that could
close the account.</p>
<p>And she had run, to protect that truth. To protect me? Or to protect
the sibling I never had?</p>
<p>The walls of names seemed to press closer, the whispers rising to a
murmur. The debt wasn’t just awake. It was confronting its own potential
end. A fifth-generation heir, born of both lines, could inherit it
all—the house, the land, and the crushing, centuries-old ledger. Or
could tear it from the stone.</p>
<p>I heard a sharp intake of breath from the doorway.</p>
<p>Razak was staring past me, his face pale in the lantern light. He was
looking at the wall behind the table.</p>
<p>I turned.</p>
<p>The lantern light washed over the stone. The ink of centuries
swirled. And there, in a fresh, dark, damp patch that gleamed in the
light, new words were forming. Not written in ink, but in something
else. Something that seeped from the very pores of the rock. They wrote
themselves in a slow, viscous trickle, following the cracks in the stone
like predetermined paths.</p>
<p><strong>THE HEIR IS HERE</strong></p>
<p><strong>SETTLE THE ACCOUNT</strong></p>
<p>And below it, the stone itself seemed to be sweating, the moisture
beading and running downward, tracing two vertical lines, and between
them, a single, weeping hyphen.</p>
<p><strong>V – I</strong></p>
<p>Five. And then, a space for Six.</p>
<p>The hook was not in the past. It was in the future. The debt was not
asking for a payment from the past. It was presenting a bill for the
future. My future. A line yet to be written.</p>
<p>The lantern flame guttered. In the sudden, plunging shadow, I felt
the strong room door, behind Razak, begin to swing shut on its broken
hinges, not with a groan, but with the soft, final sound of a book being
closed.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-5-1">CHAPTER 5</h2>
<p>The door shut with a sigh. It was the sound of a ledger being closed,
of a cover settling over wet ink. The darkness in the strong room was
absolute, a physical thing that filled my mouth and lungs, thick as the
scent of old paper and stone-sweat. The lantern had not gone out. It had
been swallowed.</p>
<p>Razak’s breath was a ragged tear in the silence beside me. “<em>Dia
hidup</em>,” he whispered. It lives.</p>
<p>The words on the wall were no longer visible, but I could feel them.
<strong>THE HEIR IS HERE.</strong> They were a pressure against my skin,
a cold draft from a future not yet born. The debt was no longer a ghost
in the ledger. It was the room. It was the air. It was the future
contracting to a single, terrible point: me, and the empty column
waiting for a sixth entry.</p>
<p>“It’s not about the past,” I said, my voice strange and flat in the
dark. “It never was. It’s a contract. And I’m the next line item.”</p>
<p>Razak’s hand found my arm, his grip tight. “We must leave this room.
Now.”</p>
<p>But the door, when I stumbled toward it, was immovable. Not locked.
<em>Full</em>. As if the darkness behind us had solidified and packed
itself against the wood. I pushed until my shoulders screamed. Nothing.
The <em>belian</em> wood, iron-hard and black, had become a wall of the
earth itself.</p>
<p>“The other way,” Razak said, his voice taut with a fear he was
forcing into practicality. “The passage. To the house.”</p>
<p>The thought of turning my back on that weeping wall, of entering the
deeper dark of the tunnel, was a cold nausea in my gut. But the dark in
front of the door was colder. It had a taste—like the static before a
lightning strike, like the silence in a coffin.</p>
<p>I fumbled for the lantern. My fingers closed around the warm brass
base. The glass was cool. I shook it. The slosh of kerosene was a tiny,
hopeful sound. A match scraped, a brief, sulphuric flower blooming in
Razak’s cupped hands. He touched it to the wick.</p>
<p>The flame that rose was wrong.</p>
<p>It was not the warm, yolk-yellow glow from before. It was a pallid,
blue-tinged thing, shrunken and meek. It did not push the darkness back;
it defined it, painting a small, trembling circle of visibility that
seemed only to emphasize the infinite black pressing in. In its sickly
light, Razak’s face was a mask of carved shadow, his eyes pools of
ink.</p>
<p>The wall was still weeping. The symbols <strong>V – I</strong>
glistened, the moisture tracing them over and over, an endless, silent
penance. And below, the stone was dark. Waiting.</p>
<p>“Go,” I said.</p>
<p>We went.</p>
<hr />
<p>The tunnel did not feel like an escape. It felt like a throat. The
cold, damp air moved past us in a slow exhalation that smelled of
root-rot and wet clay. Our footsteps were muffled, eaten by the earth.
The pale lantern light licked the rough-hewn walls, revealing nothing
but the occasional glint of a root-tip, white and blind as a worm.</p>
<p>The silence was a weight. It was the silence of the ledger’s pages,
of names written and forgotten. My own breath sounded obscenely loud.
Every rustle of my clothing was a betrayal. I was a disturbance in a
long, deep sleep.</p>
<p>And then, the sleep ended.</p>
<p>It began as a vibration in the soles of my feet, a hum through the
packed earth. Then a sound, threading itself into the silence from
somewhere ahead. A rhythmic, metallic <em>click-clack, click-clack</em>.
The sound of an abacus.</p>
<p>My blood turned to silt. Razak halted, one hand going to the wall for
support.</p>
<p>“Do you hear—”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>It was not loud. It was precise. Insistent. The dry click of wooden
beads on iron rods, counting, always counting. It came from no direction
and every direction, woven into the fabric of the tunnel itself.</p>
<p>We moved toward it. There was no other choice. To go back was the
solid dark of the strong room. To stay was to be buried alive with that
sound. The tunnel began to change. The earthen walls gave way to old
brick, moss-slick and uneven. The ceiling dipped, forcing us to stoop.
The <em>click-clack</em> grew clearer, a merciless arithmetic.</p>
<p>The tunnel opened abruptly, disgorging us into a space the lantern
could not fully comprehend.</p>
<p>We were in a cellar, vast and low-ceilinged. The air was frigid and
still, heavy with the smell of damp mortar and something else—the faint,
acrid tang of old ink and dust. The lantern’s shrunken flame revealed
pillars of rough stone, holding up the darkness. And between them,
shapes.</p>
<p>Stacks of them. Towers of them. Ledgers.</p>
<p>Not just a few. Hundreds. Thousands. They lined crude wooden shelves
carved into the earth walls, they rose in teetering pillars from the
packed dirt floor, they lay in great, slumping mounds like the ruins of
a paper city. Their covers were leather, cloth, wood, some so old they
were just hardened, unidentifiable skin. They were the archive. The gut
of the debt.</p>
<p>And in the center of it all, at a low table of black <em>belian</em>
wood, a figure sat.</p>
<p>He was bent over a massive, open ledger, a pen in his hand. He wore a
white linen suit, gone grey with age and dust, hanging loose on a frame
that was all sharp angles. His hair was a silver brush-cut, precise. He
did not look up as we entered. His hand moved, the nib scratching a dry,
endless line on the page. <em>Click-clack</em> went the abacus by his
right elbow, its beads moving of their own accord.</p>
<p>Robert Thorne.</p>
<p>Not a ghost. A memory. A memory made so solid by repetition, by the
relentless act of accounting, that it had worn a groove in the house’s
bones and taken up residence.</p>
<p>He finished his line, blotted it with a precise tap. Only then did he
lift his head.</p>
<p>His face was not cruel. It was empty. It was the face of a man who
has reduced the world to columns of figures, who sees lives as assets
and liabilities, births as credits, deaths as debits. His eyes were
pale, washed-out blue, like faded ink. They passed over Razak as if he
were an item of furniture, and settled on me.</p>
<p>“You are late,” he said. His voice was dry as pressed leaves, without
inflection.</p>
<p>My own voice was trapped somewhere beneath my heart. “Late?”</p>
<p>“For the reconciliation.” He gestured with his pen to a vacant stool
on the other side of the table. “Sit. We must balance the sheet.”</p>
<p>This was the mortal enemy. Not a monster, not a spirit. A clerk. A
man who had turned love into a collateral, a child into a settlement.
His weapon was not a knife, but a precedent. His battlefield was this
table.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to balance,” I said, the words scraping out. “It’s
over. The account is closed.”</p>
<p>Robert Thorne’s thin lips pressed into a line that was not a smile.
It was a correction. “An account is never closed. It is merely carried
forward.” He flipped back through the ledger before him with a practiced
hand. The pages whispered, a sound like dead leaves in a gutter. He
stopped, his finger stabbing down. “Here. The discrepancy. A birth,
recorded in the female line. An asset, removed from the ledger without
proper offsetting entry. An imbalance.”</p>
<p>He looked up, his pale eyes holding me. “You are the imbalance. You
are the unresolved entry. Sit.”</p>
<p>The <em>click-clack</em> of the abacus grew louder, more frantic. It
seemed to come from all around, from the thousands of ledgers, a chorus
of accounting. The cold of the cellar seeped into my bones, a logical,
inescapable cold. I understood, with a dread that was crystalline, that
this was the battle. Not with fists or fury, but with the very logic of
the house. To argue with him was to accept his terms. To sit at that
table was to be entered into the ledger.</p>
<p>Razak stepped forward. “The <em>rumah</em> is tired of your numbers,
<em>Tuan</em>,” he said, his voice low but clear in the dusty silence.
“It weeps your name on the wall. It wants an end.”</p>
<p>For the first time, Robert Thorne’s expression shifted. A flicker of
annoyance, the impatience of a mathematician interrupted by irrational
noise. “Sentiment,” he stated, “is a liability. It clouds the judgement.
It leads to…” he glanced at the ledger, “…unsecured debts. The house
does not weep. It calculates. And the calculation is clear. The asset
must be returned to the ledger, or a compensating value must be
extracted.” His eyes returned to me. “You are the heir. You are the
value. Sit.”</p>
<p>The command was in the air, in the clicking beads, in the weight of
all that paper. It was a gravity, pulling me toward the stool. My legs
moved. I fought them, but they were traitors, carrying me forward. I saw
my hand reach out, grip the back of the stool. The wood was icy.</p>
<p>This was the high-stakes crisis. Not a fight for my life, but for my
very definition. Would I become a line in his book? A value to be
settled? My greatest fear was not death. It was erasure. It was having
my messy, unresolved life distilled into a neat, fatal entry.</p>
<p>I sat.</p>
<p>The moment my weight settled on the stool, the cellar changed. The
walls of ledgers seemed to lean in, their spines whispering. The light
from our pathetic lantern bled away, and a new, sourceless glow emerged,
illuminating only the table, Robert Thorne, and me. Razak was gone,
swallowed by the outer dark. We were in a bubble of pure
transaction.</p>
<p>“Good,” Robert said, a note of satisfaction in his dry voice. He
pulled a fresh sheet of paper from a drawer—thick, cream-colored
paper—and set it before me. He placed a pen, heavy and silver-cold, next
to it. “You will write the entry.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to write.”</p>
<p>“The truth,” he said, as if it were simple. “The final truth of the
account. Your name. Your date of birth. And your value.” He pushed a
brass ruler toward me. “Draw the line. Beneath it.”</p>
<p>My hand trembled as I picked up the pen. It was weighted for a steady
hand, a decisive one. Mine was neither. I looked at the blank paper. It
was a void. A future. To write was to accept. To define myself in his
terms. Heir. Value. Entry.</p>
<p>I touched the nib to the paper. A blot of black ink spread, a tiny,
hungry dark star.</p>
<p>“My name is not in your ledger,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“All names are in the ledger,” he replied. “Some are merely…
pending.”</p>
<p>I thought of my mother. Not the ghost in the garden, but the woman
who had packed a single bag in the dead of night. Who had chosen the
unrecorded life, the unbalanced sheet, the mystery. She had run from
this table. And I had walked to it and sat down.</p>
<p>I began to write. Not my name. I wrote the date. The date from the
solicitor’s letter. The date I had arrived.</p>
<p>Robert Thorne watched, his head tilted like a bookkeeper spotting an
error. “That is not your birth.”</p>
<p>“It is my arrival,” I said, the pen scratching. “The date the heir
entered the account.”</p>
<p>A faint line appeared between his pale eyebrows. The abacus hesitated
for a single, silent second. I kept writing. I wrote the name of the
house. <em>Rumah Besar</em>. I wrote the latitude and longitude I’d seen
on the old survey map in the library. I wrote the chemical composition
of <em>belian</em> wood. I was not writing an entry. I was writing a
context. A place. A thing.</p>
<p>“This is irrelevant data,” Robert said, his voice gaining a sharp
edge. “The entry requires a <em>value</em>.”</p>
<p>“I’m getting to it,” I said, and my voice was stronger. I was not
filling his form. I was writing a different story. I wrote the scent of
champaca and rot. I wrote the sound of rain digested by wood. I wrote
the taste of <em>teh tarik</em> on a monsoon afternoon. I wrote Razak’s
name. I wrote my grandmother’s name. I wrote <em>Anak Emas</em>.</p>
<p>The pen flew. The ink flowed. I was not settling an account. I was
describing a world. His ledger could not hold it. His columns were too
narrow.</p>
<p>Robert Thorne stood up. The stool screeched against the stone floor.
“Stop. You are corrupting the record.”</p>
<p>But I couldn’t stop. The memories were a flood, and they were my
identity, and they were my weapon. I wrote about the fear in my mother’s
eyes in a faded photograph. I wrote about the hollow in my father’s
stories. I wrote about the silence that had been my inheritance, and the
whispers that now filled it. I wrote about the wall that wept future
dates.</p>
<p>“I AM NOT A NUMBER!” I shouted, and the words were not mine
alone—they were my mother’s, my grandmother’s, the cry of every name
that had been reduced to an entry.</p>
<p>I slammed the pen down. The paper was a chaos of ink, a storm of
lived experience. No lines. No columns. Just a sprawling, magnificent,
unbalanced mess.</p>
<p>Robert Thorne stared at it. His empty face was a mask of pure,
uncomprehending horror. This was his defeat. Not by a greater logic, but
by the sheer, unmanageable volume of life. You could not carry
<em>this</em> forward. You could not file it. It was too real.</p>
<p>The abacus gave a final, discordant rattle and fell silent.</p>
<p>The bubble of light began to contract. The ledgers on the shelves
started to vibrate. A low rumble filled the cellar, not of earth, but of
tearing paper, of spines cracking.</p>
<p>“You have broken the system,” Robert whispered, and for the first
time, there was something in his voice besides emptiness. There was
fear. The fear of a man whose god—order—has been blasphemed.</p>
<p>The ledger before him, the great book of the debt, began to curl at
the edges. The ink on its pages swam, the neat columns blurring, the
names running into each other like tears. He reached for it, to save it,
to hold the numbers in place.</p>
<p>His hands passed through the page.</p>
<p>He looked at his own hands, translucent and shimmering in the failing
light. The memory was unraveling, its purpose—to account, to
balance—obliterated by my refusal to be summed up.</p>
<p>The cellar was dissolving. The ledgers were melting into streams of
dark slurry, like ink-stained snow. The walls of earth sighed and
shifted.</p>
<p>I stood, pushing the stool back. It toppled over, the sound swallowed
by the growing roar. Robert Thorne was fading, his outline blurring into
the chaotic dark, his pale eyes fixed on the ruined ledger until they
were nothing but two last points of light, which winked out.</p>
<p>The floor fell away.</p>
<hr />
<p>I did not fall. I was poured.</p>
<p>I tumbled through a cascade of paper scraps, of swirling ink, of
numbers and names divorced from their meanings. It was the debt,
disintegrating. It was the past, un-filed. It was a hurricane of
forgotten transactions.</p>
<p>And then, impact. Not on stone, but on something giving and wet.</p>
<p>I lay on my back, gasping. The roar subsided into a drip, a sigh, a
familiar, deep-throated digestion of water. I smelled wet earth and
champaca. I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I was in the garden. The monsoon rain fell in a soft, steady curtain,
but here, under the canopy of the great <em>angsana</em> tree, it was
only a patter. I was lying in a bed of rotting blossoms and mud. The
house loomed before me, its windows dark, drinking the rain with that
same deep, wet sigh.</p>
<p>I was alive. I was out.</p>
<p>But it was not the same garden. The light was wrong—a bruised,
twilight grey, though it had been deep night when we entered the strong
room. The air was thick, pressed flat. And the garden itself… it was
both there and not there. I could see the frangipani trees, the
overgrown paths, but they were overlaid with a faint, shimmering
transparency. I could see <em>through</em> them to another version of
the garden: neater, younger, the paths clear, the trees smaller.</p>
<p>Memory. I was lying in a palimpsest of the garden’s own memory.</p>
<p>I pushed myself up, my body aching as if I had been physically
beaten. My clothes were stained with mud and strange, ink-like smudges.
I was alone.</p>
<p>“Razak?”</p>
<p>My voice was swallowed by the layered silence. The rain fell through
the memory of an older rain. I saw a figure then, a ghost in the
ghost-garden. A woman in a simple <em>kebaya</em>, walking quickly down
the now-clear path, her head bowed against a rain that had fallen
decades ago. She carried a bundle in her arms, clutched tightly to her
chest.</p>
<p>My breath caught. It was my grandmother. Young. Fear in the set of
her shoulders.</p>
<p>She was not alone. Behind her, from the direction of the servants’
quarters, a man emerged. He was tall, European, dressed in a
rain-slicked coat. Robert Thorne. But a younger Robert, his face not yet
empty, but set in lines of furious, frustrated determination. He called
out a name. A name the rain stole.</p>
<p>My grandmother—<em>Mak</em>—did not turn. She broke into a run,
vanishing into the thick foliage near the wall, the bundle held
close.</p>
<p>Robert Thorne stopped, his fists clenched at his sides. He stood
there in the phantom rain, watching the space where she had disappeared.
And then, slowly, he turned his head. He looked directly at the spot
where I now lay.</p>
<p>He could not see me. I knew that. He was seeing a future he was
already trying to calculate. He was seeing the consequence. The
unresolved entry.</p>
<p>The memory bled, colors running like wet ink. The younger garden
faded, leaving only the present, overgrown one. The rain was just rain.
The silence was just silence.</p>
<p>I had faced the clerk of the debt and drowned him in the
un-accountable. I had suffered the defeat of sitting at his table, of
almost becoming his entry. And in the lowest moment, with the pen in my
hand, I had found my strength. It was not in my name, but in my
memories. Not in my value, but in my context. My identity was not a sum.
It was a story. And stories cannot be balanced; they can only be
told.</p>
<p>I had overcome by refusing the terms of the ordeal. The reward was
this: the unraveling of the system. The cellar of ledgers was gone.
Robert Thorne’s persistent memory was erased. But the debt itself… the
debt was not a ledger. The debt was the <em>pattern</em>. And patterns
are harder to kill than ghosts.</p>
<p>I saw Razak then. He was standing by the side of the <em>rumah
besar</em>, one hand on the black wood, his head bowed as if listening.
He was solid. Real. In the present.</p>
<p>I stumbled to my feet and made my way to him. The mud sucked at my
shoes. He heard me approach and turned. His face was etched with
exhaustion, but his eyes were clear.</p>
<p>“You are here,” he said, as if he hadn’t been sure.</p>
<p>“Where is ‘here’?” I asked, my voice raw.</p>
<p>“The garden. Now. But the house… it is dreaming. You broke the
clockwork. Now the dream is loose.” He nodded toward the house.
“Look.”</p>
<p>I followed his gaze. The windows of the <em>rumah besar</em> were no
longer dark. In each one, a soft, phosphorescent glow pulsed, like the
slow beat of a heart. Not firelight. Memory-light. Scenes flickered
behind the glass: a dinner party with silent laughter; a child running
down a corridor; a woman staring out at the rain; two men arguing over a
map. Fragments. Unfiled moments, bleeding out of the walls now that the
ledger was gone.</p>
<p>“The strong room?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The door was open when I woke here. The wall…” He shook his head, a
slow, weary motion. “The writing is gone. The stone is dry. But the
space for the sixth entry… it is still there. A blank stone.”</p>
<p>The account was unsettled. The system was broken. But the hook—the
empty space for the future—remained. It had just changed shape.</p>
<p>“He wanted me to write my name,” I said. “To finish the line. I wrote
everything but that.”</p>
<p>Razak looked at me for a long moment. The phantom rain glistened in
his hair. “You did not give him a name. You gave him a world. A world is
too heavy for a column. It broke the page.” A faint, grim smile touched
his lips. “But a world is also a responsibility. The house is that
world. And it is… unmoored.”</p>
<p>A sound cut through the rain’s digestion then. Not from the house.
From the direction of the front gate. The crunch of gravel. The low
growl of a car engine.</p>
<p>Headlights swept through the rain, painting the driveway in two bars
of white. The car, a dark, sleek sedan, came to a stop. The engine cut
off.</p>
<p>The driver’s door opened. A man got out. He was tall, wearing a
trench coat against the rain. He didn’t hurry. He stood by the car,
looking up at the house, its windows now flickering with stolen
memories. Then he reached back into the car and pulled out a
briefcase.</p>
<p>He turned, and the security light by the gate caught his face.</p>
<p>It was a face I knew from a dozen boardroom photos in financial
magazines. A face that shared the set of my own jaw, the shape of my own
eyes, though his were colder, shielded by the gloss of wealth and
certainty.</p>
<p>My father.</p>
<p>He had not come when the solicitor called. He had not answered my
messages. He had come now. Now, when the ledger was broken and the house
was dreaming with its wounds open. He closed the car door and started
walking, steady and deliberate, up the path toward the <em>rumah
besar</em>, toward the weeping stone and the empty column. His
briefcase, heavy and metallic grey, swung slightly in his grip.</p>
<p>He was not here for a reunion. He was here for a reconciliation. A
different kind. He was the present, arriving to claim the unmoored past.
To perhaps write the sixth entry with a newer, colder ink.</p>
<p>I stood with Razak in the shadow of the tree, the memories of the
house flickering around us like dying fireflies, and watched him come.
The heir was here. The account was open. And the future, blank and
waiting, had just walked through the gate.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-6-1">CHAPTER 6</h2>
<p>The rain had stopped digesting. It had become a memory itself, a
slick black film on the <em>belian</em> wood and the gravel, holding the
ghost-light of the house’s projections in its sheen. The air was a held
breath, thick with the aftermath of poured-out stories. And into that
stillness, my father walked.</p>
<p>His footsteps were a punctuation. Each one a period marking the end
of a sentence I thought I was writing. He didn’t look at the caretaker’s
cottage, didn’t glance toward the shadow of the <em>angsana</em> tree
where Razak and I stood, frozen. His gaze was fixed on the <em>rumah
besar</em>, on the column that was not a column but a wound, weeping its
silent, stone-dust tears. The flickers of memory—Grandmother at her
desk, the young Razak, the ink-stained ledger—played across the planes
of his face, but they did not change it. They were slides projected onto
a cliff.</p>
<p>“He sees it,” I whispered. The words were smoke in the damp air.</p>
<p>Razak’s voice was a low rumble, the sound of the earth settling. “He
has always seen it. He chose a different column to lean upon. Numbers.
Contracts. Columns that do not weep.”</p>
<p>My father reached the veranda steps. He paused, setting the metallic
briefcase down beside him. He removed his trench coat, folded it once,
twice, with a precise, military neatness, and laid it over the railing.
He was dressed in a suit the colour of a deep bruise. He looked up at
the house, his head tilting as he studied the empty space where the
ledger’s world had broken through. He did not look like a man seeing a
miracle. He looked like a surveyor assessing structural damage.</p>
<p>Then, he turned. His eyes found me in the shadows. They were my eyes,
but where mine felt like rooms cluttered with inherited furniture, his
were cleared, vacuum-sealed. The security light glinted off them,
turning them into glass.</p>
<p>“Lydia,” he said. My name was not a greeting. It was an item on an
agenda.</p>
<p>He didn’t ask me to come over. He simply waited, the expectation a
force as palpable as the house’s gravity. I stepped out from under the
tree. The wet grass soaked through my shoes instantly, a cold shock.
Razak did not follow, but I felt his presence at my back like a rooted
thing, a part of the garden’s own memory.</p>
<p>I crossed the space between us. It felt like crossing from one
century to another. The air near him was different—colder, carrying a
faint trace of airport air-freshener and starched cotton. I stopped at
the foot of the veranda steps, looking up. He looked down.</p>
<p>“You’re here,” I said. It was all I had.</p>
<p>“The firm’s monitoring service flagged unusual energy consumption
from the estate grid,” he said, his voice flat, clean of inflection. “A
sustained, massive draw. Followed by a complete blackout. Given the…
sensitivities… of the property, I came.”</p>
<p>He spoke of the house as if it were a subsidiary. A problematic
one.</p>
<p>“The sensitivities,” I echoed. “You mean the fact that it’s dreaming.
That it just bled our family’s memories into the garden.”</p>
<p>A muscle in his jaw tightened. It was the only crack. “I mean the
fact that it is an unsecured asset with undocumented liabilities. What
happened?”</p>
<p>He was here for a report. I was the junior analyst who had broken the
server. The anger was a slow, cold infusion, like metal hardening in my
veins. I thought of the ledger, of the weight of the name I hadn’t
given, of the world that had broken the page. He would call it a
liability.</p>
<p>“Grandmother’s ledger,” I said, forcing the words out. “It wasn’t a
record. It was a… a foundation. I finished an entry. The sixth. It broke
something. It showed us things.”</p>
<p>“Finished?” The word was sharp. “You wrote in it?”</p>
<p>“I gave a man a world,” I said, the phrase from Razak feeling true
and heavy on my tongue. “Because someone, probably her, gave him nothing
but a blank space and a weight.”</p>
<p>My father’s gaze flickered over my shoulder, toward Razak. A
calculation was made, dismissed. “Razak. Still tending the ghosts.”</p>
<p>“Someone must, Tuan David,” Razak’s voice came from the darkness,
calm as deep water. “They grow hungry when ignored.”</p>
<p>My father ignored this. He looked back at the house. “And the ledger
now?”</p>
<p>“Gone. Dissolved. The column… absorbed it.”</p>
<p>He nodded, as if this confirmed a suspicion. He bent and picked up
the briefcase. The latches made a sound like cracking teeth in the
silence. “Then the account is closed. A literal clean slate.” He placed
the briefcase on the veranda floor, knelt before it, and opened it.</p>
<p>It was not full of papers. Nestled in grey foam were two objects. One
was a sleek, black rectangular device, like a hardened tablet. The other
was a gunmetal grey cylinder, about the length of a forearm, covered in
faint, etched patterns that seemed to move in the peripheral vision.</p>
<p>“What is that?” I asked, the cold in my veins turning to ice.</p>
<p>“The reconciliation,” he said, not looking at me. He powered on the
tablet. A soft, blue-white light illuminated his face from below. He
began tapping, swiping. “The past is an unmoored asset. It creates
volatility. Risk. My mother never understood that. She thought you could
curate memory. You can’t. You can only manage it. Or,” he said, lifting
the cylinder, “you can collateralize it.”</p>
<p>He rose, cylinder in hand, and walked toward the weeping column.</p>
<p>“Stop.” The word left my mouth before I thought it.</p>
<p>He didn’t stop. He approached the column as if it were a faulty piece
of machinery. He raised the cylinder. The etched patterns on it began to
glow with a cool, silver light.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” I was moving up the steps now.</p>
<p>“Anchoring the asset,” he said. “This house, its… consciousness… is a
form of unstructured data. A unique, localized energy field tied to
physical location and biological legacy—our DNA. It has value.
Extraordinary value. But only if it is stabilized, quantified, and
secured.”</p>
<p>He placed the cylinder against the stone, just below the weeping
fissure. The stone did not reject it. Instead, the grey metal seemed to
sink in, as if the column were soft clay. The weeping slowed. The
stone-dust tears thinned, then stopped. The cylinder was now
half-embedded, its glowing end protruding like a cold, mechanical
heart.</p>
<p>A low hum vibrated through the veranda floor, up through the soles of
my feet. It was not the house’s sigh. It was a new sound, a sterile,
electronic thrum. The flickering memories around the garden—the last
echoes of Grandmother’s poured-out story—stuttered. They pixelated, like
a corrupted video file, then snapped off. The garden was plunged into a
darkness that felt suddenly empty, just dark, just wet. The house’s
presence, that constant, breathing weight at the edge of perception,
receded. It was still there, but muffled. Blanketed.</p>
<p>He had silenced it.</p>
<p>“You’re draining it,” I breathed, horror a taste like copper in my
mouth.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>banking</em> it,” he corrected, turning back to his tablet.
A stream of data flowed across the screen—complex waveforms, cascading
numbers. “The energy signature is being indexed, parsed, and transferred
to a secure server. A digital twin. The physical location remains, but
the active, volatile element is now a tradeable, securitized instrument.
A memory-bond. The first of its kind.”</p>
<p>I stared at him. The heir. He hadn’t come to inherit a house. He had
come to perform an IPO on its soul. The reconciliation was not with me,
or with the past. It was a balance sheet reconciliation. He was closing
the books on magic, and opening a new account on a digital exchange.</p>
<p>“You can’t,” I said, but it was weak. He already was.</p>
<p>“It’s already done, Lydia. The prospectus is drafted. There are
parties in Zurich, in Singapore, who understand the value of a curated,
stable emotional field. For wellness, for strategic influence, for…
experiences. This isn’t destruction. It’s preservation through
monetization. She,” he said, with a slight nod toward the house, “would
have let it rot. Or let it run wild, as it did tonight. I am saving
it.”</p>
<p>He closed his briefcase. The hum from the column was a constant now,
a background noise that made my teeth ache. The house felt like a
patient under heavy sedation.</p>
<p>“The initial transfer is complete,” he said. “The stabilizer will
remain, maintaining the field at a safe, non-volatile baseline. I’ll
have a team come to maintain the physical structure. You don’t need to
stay.”</p>
<p>The claim. The reward. It was this: understanding. A brutal,
clarifying knowledge. The victory over the house’s ordeal, the breaking
of the ledger’s spell, had not freed anything. It had simply rendered
the asset liquid. And my father, the ultimate accountant, had come to
collect. The power I had earned was the power to see the machinery of
the world, cold and gleaming, as it stripped the mystery for parts.</p>
<p>I had given a man a world. My father had put a price on it.</p>
<p>“You’re wrong,” I said, my voice finding a hardness I didn’t know I
owned. “She wasn’t curating memory. She was bearing witness. There’s a
difference.”</p>
<p>He looked at me then, really looked, and for a fraction of a second,
I saw not the financier, but the boy who had grown up in this swallowing
silence. A boy who must have been terrified of the weeping stones and
the hungry dark. He had built a world of numbers to keep it all out. His
column.</p>
<p>“Bearing witness is a luxury,” he said, the crack sealed over. “And
this house is a vault. Every vault needs a key, and a ledger of what’s
inside. Now it has a proper one.”</p>
<p>He picked up his coat, his briefcase. “I’ve booked you a flight back
to London for tomorrow afternoon. The car will return for you at ten.”
He walked down the steps, past me, back toward his sedan.</p>
<p>“I’m not going,” I said to his back.</p>
<p>He paused. Didn’t turn. “There’s nothing for you here now. It’s
managed.”</p>
<p>“You managed the field. You didn’t manage the story. The story is
still in the ground.”</p>
<p>He continued walking. The car door opened, closed. The engine growled
to life. The headlights swept across us, catching Razak, who had now
walked silently to stand beside me. Then the car turned and crunched
down the gravel drive, was swallowed by the night.</p>
<p>The celebration was not a party. It was a silence. A shared, furious
silence between Razak and me as we stood in the newly sterile dark. The
victory—surviving the ledger, unlocking the memory—was ashes. It had
been cut short not by a new, looming threat, but by the cold, efficient
execution of an old, quiet one. The threat of being understood in the
wrong language, of being translated into data.</p>
<p>“He has caged its breath,” Razak said, staring at the column with the
metal heart. “But a cage is a shape. A shape can be felt.”</p>
<p>“Can you remove it?” I asked, desperation leaking in.</p>
<p>He walked to the column, placed a broad, weathered hand on the stone
near the cylinder. He closed his eyes. After a long moment, he snatched
his hand back, as if burned. “No. It is not of this place. It is a null.
A hole. It does not listen. It only takes.” He looked at me, his eyes
reflecting the faint, sickly glow of the stabilizer. “It is drawing the
<em>tenaga</em> out, like water from a well. Slowly. But it will run
dry.”</p>
<p>The consequence of the ordeal was clear. The cost of the victory was
the house itself. By breaking the ledger’s page, I had made the house
vulnerable. I had turned its deepest memory inside out, and in that
exposed, raw state, my father had arrived with his syringe. I had not
saved the story; I had made it palatable for extraction.</p>
<p>We retreated to the caretaker’s cottage. The main house was no longer
a living thing to be wary of; it was a patient in intensive care. Its
silence was worse than its sighs. Razak made bitter coffee on the gas
ring. We drank it without speaking, listening to the alien hum that now
underpinned the night sounds.</p>
<p>“He said the ledger was a foundation,” I said finally. “He’s wrong.
It was a keystone. And I removed it.”</p>
<p>“You completed it,” Razak corrected. “A story demands an ending. Even
a painful one. He is trying to write a different ending. One with
numbers.”</p>
<p>“What happens when the well runs dry?”</p>
<p>Razak looked into his cup. “The house becomes a house. Wood and
stone. The memories… they become his data. Ghosts in a machine. And the
man in the ledger? The one you gave a world? His world becomes a file. A
prisoner in a null.”</p>
<p>I thought of the brief, glorious vision of the man—my
grandfather?—standing tall in the sunlight, the weight of his name
finally held. That was to be traded. Collateralized. The anger
solidified into a resolve as hard as the <em>belian</em> wood.</p>
<p>“We have to break his ledger,” I said.</p>
<p>Razak’s eyes met mine. “His ledger is made of light and code. It has
no page to break.”</p>
<p>“Then we find where he keeps the original. The server. The… the
vault.” The words felt absurd, dangerous. “We steal it back.”</p>
<p>It was then that the new sound began.</p>
<p>At first, it was just a distortion in the stabilizer’s hum. A warble.
Then a sharp, digital <em>pop</em> from the direction of the main house.
We both froze.</p>
<p>The hum died.</p>
<p>For a moment, there was only the true, deep silence of the night. And
then, the house drew a breath. A ragged, shuddering inhalation.</p>
<p>The lights in the <em>rumah besar</em> did not flicker on with
memory. They blazed with a fierce, white, electrical light. Every window
became a hard, bright rectangle. Not dream-light. Emergency light.</p>
<p>A scream tore through the night.</p>
<p>It was not a human scream. It was the sound of tearing metal, of
shearing stone, of a feedback shriek from a broken speaker. It came from
the house. It was the house.</p>
<p>We ran onto the porch. The scene was wrong. The house was not
dreaming. It was convulsing. The white light stuttered, flashing on and
off in a frantic, arrhythmic pulse. With each flash, I saw the
silhouette of the column. The metal cylinder was glowing red-hot. And
the stone around it was <em>moving</em>. Not weeping. Crawling. Like the
skin around a splinter being pushed out by angry flesh.</p>
<p>“The field is not stable,” Razak hissed. “It is fighting the null. It
is rejecting the transplant.”</p>
<p>“You said it couldn’t!”</p>
<p>“I said <em>I</em> could not! The house is not me!”</p>
<p>With a final, deafening <em>crack</em>, the cylinder was ejected. It
shot out from the column like a bullet, trailing a comet-tail of sparks
and molten stone, and clattered, hissing, across the veranda floor. The
column bled. Not dust. A thick, dark liquid that looked like ink mixed
with sap, pouring from the wound.</p>
<p>And the projections returned. But not memories. Not narratives.</p>
<p>Fragments. Shattered glass of sensation.</p>
<p>A child’s fear of the dark—a pure, cold panic—washed over the garden.
It was followed by the gut-punch of a long-ago betrayal, the taste of
medicine and regret. Then the searing heat of a forgotten afternoon sun,
the smell of hot grass. Images flickered, insane and disjointed: a
broken teacup, a snake’s scales, the pattern of rain on a window from
1947, the texture of a particular bark. The house wasn’t remembering. It
was hemorrhaging. Its curated, layered consciousness had been scrambled
by the stabilizer, then ruptured by its removal. It was vomiting raw,
undigested experience.</p>
<p>And in the centre of the storm, a figure coalesced on the
veranda.</p>
<p>It was the man from the ledger. My world-made-man. But he was not
standing tall. He was flickering, transparent, his form woven from the
chaotic fragments. One moment he was sharp, the next he was a cloud of
screaming faces, of touched objects, of forgotten smells. He was
unstable. Unmoored in a new, more terrible way. He was not a memory. He
was a memory’s catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>He turned his head. His eyes, when they solidified, found mine. They
held no recognition, no peace. They held the terror of a thing that
should not be.</p>
<p>The front door of the <em>rumah besar</em> blew open.</p>
<p>Not from wind. From a pressure from within. And from the blinding
white hallway behind it, a shape emerged.</p>
<p>It was my father.</p>
<p>But not as he had left. His suit was dishevelled. One sleeve was
torn. In his hand, he no longer carried his briefcase. He carried the
black tablet, its screen a web of cracks, glowing with an unhealthy,
greenish light. His face was a mask of a different kind—not cold
control, but furious, desperate intensity. He had not driven away. He
had circled back, entered the house from the rear. He had been inside
when the stabilizer failed.</p>
<p>He saw the flickering, fragmentary man on the veranda. He saw the
bleeding column. His eyes went to the tablet, then to me.</p>
<p>“You,” he spat, the word charged with a venom that shocked me. “You
triggered a cascade failure. The data stream reversed. It’s not just
downloading. It’s <em>uploading</em>.”</p>
<p>He looked at the chaotic storm of fragments—the smell of hot grass,
the taste of medicine, the child’s fear—washing around the garden. “It’s
pulling from the environment. From us. It’s trying to rebuild the
database from local sources. It’s contagious.”</p>
<p>As if to prove his point, a flicker of <em>his</em> memory snapped
into being beside him: a young David, my father as a boy, staring at a
column of numbers in a textbook, his face tight with a determination to
understand. The fragment dissolved into the scream of tearing metal.</p>
<p>The ledger-man—the conglomerate—took a shuddering step forward. Not
toward me. Toward my father. Toward the broken tablet. The source of the
pain.</p>
<p>My father’s eyes widened. He took a step back. For the first time in
my life, I saw fear on his face. Not fear of the irrational, but fear of
a system he had built, now rebelling against him. The antagonist was not
just wounded. The weapon had turned in his hand. The consequence of his
victory had arrived, and it was walking toward him, made of everything
the house had ever eaten.</p>
<p>“It’s not an asset,” I said, the truth dawning with cold clarity.
“It’s a predator. And you just made it hungry for something new.”</p>
<p>The fragment-man reached a shimmering hand toward the tablet. My
father stumbled back another step, off the veranda, onto the gravel
path. He looked from the thing he had helped create, to me, to Razak.
His calculation had failed. The numbers had betrayed him.</p>
<p>“It wants the rest of the data,” he said, his voice stripped of its
certainty. “The original source. The primary server. It will follow the
signal.”</p>
<p>He turned and ran. Not to his car. Into the dark of the garden,
toward the jungle path that led to the old generator shed, and beyond
that, to the cliffs. He was running from his creation.</p>
<p>The fragment-man’s head swivelled. It let out a sound that was the
aggregate of all the house’s swallowed sighs, now twisted into a single
note of pursuit. It flowed from the veranda, not quite walking, more a
directed storm of sensation, and followed him.</p>
<p>The chase was on. Not by us. By the wound. The unmoored world was
hunting its accountant.</p>
<p>Razak was already moving, grabbing a heavy <em>parang</em> from
beside the cottage door. He tossed me a powerful, rubber-coated
flashlight. “The jungle at night is its own mouth,” he said. “And now it
has two monsters in its belly. We must go.”</p>
<p>“Why? Let it have him!” The bitterness was a flood.</p>
<p>“Because if that thing consumes him, it consumes his memories, his
knowledge. It becomes him, plus the house, plus everything else. It
becomes something that knows how to use a bank. A storm that can read a
balance sheet.” His gaze was grim. “We must reach the server first. Or
destroy it.”</p>
<p>The cost of the victory was now the future. The consequence was a
chase through the dark, not away from the past, but into the heart of a
hybrid terror—part memory, part machine, all hunger. The celebration was
long over. The ordeal had birthed a new one.</p>
<p>I clicked on the flashlight. Its beam cut a frail, shaking path into
the dripping dark. Razak stepped into it, the <em>parang</em> a dull
gleam in his hand. I took one last look at the <em>rumah besar</em>,
bleeding and blazing in its chaotic agony. Then I followed him, off the
gravel, onto the soft, consuming earth of the path, into the jungle
where my father fled and the thing we had made gave chase. The heir and
the asset were gone. All that was left were the witnesses, running to
outpace a reckoning that was writing itself in real-time, in a language
of broken code and screaming stone.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-7-1">CHAPTER 7</h2>
<p>The jungle was eating the flashlight beam.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a darkness, but a consumption. The downpour had softened to
a persistent, mossy drizzle, and the light from the heavy torch in my
hand struck the wall of green ahead and dissolved. It was swallowed by
the wet gleam of broad leaves, the fibrous tangle of lianas, the deep,
velvet black between the trunks. All that reached us, moving too fast on
the slick mud of the path, was a shallow circle of frantic illumination,
a coin dropped into a bottomless well.</p>
<p>Razak moved ahead of me, a silhouette against the eaten light. The
<em>parang</em> in his hand was not a blade but a sliver of heavier
dark. His breathing was steady, a low engine. Mine was a ragged tear in
the fabric of the night. We were not running. The path was too
treacherous, a slick intestine of roots and clay. We were stumbling with
a terrible urgency, a forced march into a throat.</p>
<p>The house was behind us, but its absence was a new presence. The
<em>rumah besar</em>’s chaotic blaze was gone, replaced by the deeper,
older chaos of the jungle. But the house had sent something out. The air
still vibrated with the after-image of that aggregate sigh, the sound of
the fragment-man in motion. It was ahead of us, somewhere in the wet
black, following the psychic spoor of my father’s fear. We were
following the follower. A chain of hunger, with us as the weakest, most
foolish link.</p>
<p>“He will go to the cliffs,” Razak said, his voice a low scrape
against the jungle’s digesting silence. “The shed is a ruse. The path
behind it, to the sea. He thinks he has a boat.”</p>
<p>“Does he?”</p>
<p>“He did. Two days ago, I pulled its rotten hull onto the rocks and
broke it with an axe. For firewood.”</p>
<p>A cold, sharp admiration cut through my fear. Razak had been
preparing for an exit, but not his own. He had been closing doors.</p>
<p>The memory of my father’s face—that final, pristine calculation
crumbling into animal panic—was a stone in my shoe. I carried it. The
bitterness I’d shouted at Razak (<em>Let it have him!</em>) was still
true, a hot coal in my chest, but it was now ringed by a colder, more
terrifying truth. His becoming a meal for that thing was not an end. It
was a transfusion. The thought of the fragment-man, that storm of
sensation, gaining the ordered, venomous knowledge of my father’s mind…
it was a new kind of haunting. A ghost that could compound interest.</p>
<p>The path began to climb, the mud giving way to knuckles of limestone
covered in a skin of moss. The trees thinned slightly, their canopy
opening to a smear of cloud-veiled sky. The drizzle was a cold kiss on
my face. I risked a glance back. Below, through a tear in the foliage, I
saw the <em>rumah besar</em>. It was no longer a riot of light. It was a
crouched, black silhouette against the lesser black of the night, a hole
in the world. One or two windows still flickered with a sullen, amber
glow—the last of the generator’s fuel, or perhaps the house itself,
burning a different kind of energy. It looked like a skull with dying
coals for eyes.</p>
<p>I turned back, and the beam of my flashlight caught it.</p>
<p>Not the fragment-man. Something else. A glistening.</p>
<p>The path ahead, where it curved around a giant <em>tapang</em> tree,
was weeping. Not water. The bark of the tree, the ferns at its base, the
very air seemed to be beading with a viscous, silver-black fluid. It
dripped with a slow, deliberate gravity. Where it struck the ground, it
didn’t soak in. It pooled, like mercury, holding its form.</p>
<p>Razak stopped, his arm barring my chest. We stood, our breath pluming
in the frail light.</p>
<p>“It is bleeding,” he whispered.</p>
<p>The fragment-man had passed this way. This was its spoor. Not a
physical trail, but a metaphysical one. A leakage of un-matter, of
activated memory. The house’s wound, wandering.</p>
<p>As we watched, a droplet coalesced on a fern frond directly in our
path. It grew, a perfect, shuddering orb of black mirror. In its curved
surface, my flashlight beam did not reflect. It was swallowed. And then,
from within the swallowed light, an image bloomed.</p>
<p>A memory. Not mine.</p>
<p>A sun-drenched veranda, long ago. A young woman in a <em>kebaya</em>,
her back to us, looking out at a lawn. Her shoulders were shaking with
silent laughter. The scent of <em>chendana</em> sandalwood and clove
cigarettes ghosted through the wet air for a second, then vanished. The
droplet fell. It hit the ground with a soft <em>plink</em>, not of
liquid, but of breaking glass, and the silver-black pool rippled, and
the ripples held the after-echo of the laughter.</p>
<p>The jungle was not just digesting light. It was digesting time. The
fragment-man was a leaky vessel, spilling its contents as it moved. We
were walking through its shed history.</p>
<p>“Do not touch it,” Razak said, his voice tight. “Do not let it touch
you.”</p>
<p>We edged past the weeping tree, giving the glistening pools a wide
berth. The air here was cold, colder than the drizzle warranted. It was
the cold of a forgotten room. My skin prickled. Every droplet was a
potential window, a silent, screaming eye. We were not just in the
jungle. We were inside the thing’s expanding biography.</p>
<p>The path grew steeper, the limestone breaking through in raw, jagged
teeth. The sound of the sea began to intrude—a distant, rhythmic
exhalation, the world’s lungs. We were nearing the cliffs.</p>
<p>Then, we heard the scream.</p>
<p>It was not human. It was the sound of a system failing. A high,
wire-taut shriek of pure feedback, woven through with the crumbling of
stone and the snap of branches. It came from ahead, around the next
bend, and it was cut off with a sudden, wet finality.</p>
<p>A new sound followed. A slow, grinding crunch. The sound of
digestion.</p>
<p>Razak and I froze. The chase was over.</p>
<p>He met my eyes, and in the backwash of the flashlight, I saw no
triumph, only a profound weariness. He gave a single, sharp nod. We
moved forward, slower now, placing each foot with deliberate
silence.</p>
<p>The path opened onto a bare, rocky promontory that thrust like a
stone jaw over the sea. The generator shed was a slumped shadow to the
left. To the right, the cliff edge dropped away into the roar of surf on
rocks.</p>
<p>My father was gone.</p>
<p>The fragment-man was not.</p>
<p>It stood in the centre of the promontory, its form in the beam of my
light both less and more than before. It was consolidating. The chaotic
swirl of sensation had drawn inwards, becoming denser, more defined. I
could make out the vague suggestion of limbs, a torso, a head. It was
sculpting itself from the air and the memory and the matter it had
consumed. And it was using a new template.</p>
<p>Patches of its form resolved into the crisp, grey weave of my
father’s suit jacket. A strand of its hair—if it was hair—fell across a
not-face in the exact, precise sweep of his silver side-part. One hand,
half-formed, held a phantom briefcase of shimmering static.</p>
<p>It had eaten him. It was becoming him.</p>
<p>As we watched, it turned its head. Where a face should have been was
a vortex of faint, skittering images—the flicker of a computer monitor,
the grain of old ledger paper, the cold shine of a Rolex watch face. It
was a face assembled from his priorities.</p>
<p>It saw us. The vortex-face pulsed.</p>
<p>A sound emerged, not from it, but from the world around us. The
grinding of stone, the sigh of the wind through the cliff grasses, the
distant crash of waves—all coalesced into a single, coherent sentence.
The voice was the landscape speaking with my father’s diction.</p>
<p>“The asset… is secure.”</p>
<p>The words were calm, logical, utterly insane. They hung in the wet
air.</p>
<p>Razak raised the <em>parang</em>. It was a gesture of heartbreaking
futility. How do you cut a memory? How do you kill an equation?</p>
<p>The fragment-man—the fragment-<em>father</em>—took a step toward us.
It did not walk. The space between it and us simply compressed. The
ground at its feet did not support it; it <em>agreed</em> with it. The
rock wept another droplet of silver-black. In it, I saw a fleeting
image: myself, age seven, standing small and confused in the echoing
lobby of his Singapore office, waiting for a birthday lunch that would
end after the appetizer.</p>
<p>It was using him. Using his memories as weapons, as tools, as a new
operating system.</p>
<p>“The primary objective is preservation,” the landscape-voice stated.
The cliff edge behind it trembled, shedding a shower of pebbles. “The
server is the corpus. It must be… integrated.”</p>
<p>It wanted the server. It wanted to complete the circuit. To become
not just a memory of a man, but a memory with the full, terrible agency
of the system he had built. A self-replicating, perpetual debt. A ghost
in the machine that <em>was</em> the machine.</p>
<p>Razak understood it a second before I did. His eyes widened not with
fear, but with a terrible, clarifying calculation. He saw the end of the
equation.</p>
<p>“The shed,” he hissed to me, not taking his eyes off the advancing
form. “The fuel drums. Go.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It is drawn to energy. To data. The server is a beacon. We must move
the beacon.” He spoke quickly, his voice low and urgent. “Take the
flashlight. Run to the shed. Open the drums. Make a spill. A big one.
Then get out.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>He hefted the <em>parang</em>. His smile was a thin, grim cut in the
darkness. “I am going to be a very compelling argument.”</p>
<p>The fragment-father took another compression-step. The air turned
cold and dry, the smell of old paper and disinfectant cutting through
the salt and rot.</p>
<p>“Compliance is the optimal return,” it intoned.</p>
<p>“Run!” Razak roared.</p>
<p>He did not charge the thing. He charged the <em>ground</em> in front
of it, bringing the <em>parang</em> down in a mighty arc not at the
form, but at the limestone at its feet. The iron blade struck sparks
from the rock with a shriek.</p>
<p>The thing flinched. Not from the blade, but from the sudden, sharp,
<em>real</em> violence of the sound. It was a spike of pure, unprocessed
<em>now</em> in its world of layered <em>then</em>. Its vortex-face
stuttered.</p>
<p>I ran.</p>
<p>I veered left, away from the cliff edge, toward the low, dark shape
of the generator shed. My heart was a frantic bird in my throat. The
beam of the flashlight jounced wildly, making the world a strobe of
terror: a glimpse of corrugated iron, a padlock, the rusted bulk of a
fuel drum.</p>
<p>Behind me, I heard not a fight, but a conversation of wrongness. The
crunch of Razak’s <em>parang</em> striking rock again. The low, subsonic
groan of the earth answering the fragment-father’s will. A sound like
tearing silk that might have been the fabric of the air itself.</p>
<p>The shed door was held by a simple hasp and a heavy padlock, rusted
shut. I didn’t hesitate. I grabbed a fist-sized rock and brought it down
on the mechanism with all my strength. Once, twice. The metal screamed
and gave. I wrenched the door open.</p>
<p>The smell hit me: petrol, grease, decay. The shed was a tomb for a
dead generator. In the centre sat the hulking, silent machine. Against
the far wall were three large, steel drums. I shoved the flashlight into
my armpit, its beam pointing at the ceiling, and grabbed the nearest
drum. It was appallingly heavy, full to the brim. I rocked it, once,
twice, feeling the liquid slosh inside. My muscles screamed in protest.
With a final, desperate heave, I tipped it over.</p>
<p>The roar of the fuel pouring out was louder than the sea. The
volatile, stinking river gushed across the concrete floor, seeking the
low points, flowing toward the door, toward the night.</p>
<p>I grabbed the second drum. My hands were slick with sweat and rain. I
couldn’t get a grip. I fumbled, and it fell back with a hollow boom. The
fragment-father’s voice echoed from outside, no longer calm. It was
layered with interference, with a rising tide of other voices—the sigh
of the house, the scream of the server, my father’s clipped tones
fraying into static.</p>
<p>“<strong>NON-OPTIMAL. CEASE.</strong>”</p>
<p>I braced my foot against the wall, wrapped my arms around the cold
steel, and pulled with everything I had. The drum tilted, teetered, and
fell with a crash, adding its contents to the spreading, glistening
lake. The fumes were dizzying, a toxic fog that burned my eyes and
throat.</p>
<p>I stumbled back to the doorway, gasping. The scene outside was a
tableau from a broken myth.</p>
<p>Razak stood between the fragment-father and the shed. He was
breathing heavily, the <em>parang</em> held low. His shirt was torn. A
long, shallow cut on his arm gleamed wetly in the ambient light, but it
was not bleeding red. It was beading with the same silver-black fluid
that had wept from the trees. The thing had touched him. It had marked
him.</p>
<p>The fragment-father was changing. The suit-jacket illusion was gone,
subsumed back into the swirling storm. But it was more focused now, more
<em>intentional</em>. It had learned from the interruption. It was a
column of directed fury, and at its core, like a dark jewel, I could see
the cold, relentless logic of my father’s mind, piloting the chaos.</p>
<p>It saw me in the doorway. Saw the black lake of fuel spreading at my
feet.</p>
<p>Its form pulsed, a wave of distorting pressure.</p>
<p>“The asset… is here,” it said, and its voice was the guttural rumble
of the generator that had once lived in this shed.</p>
<p>It moved toward me, ignoring Razak.</p>
<p>Razak moved faster. He didn’t try to strike it. He threw himself
<em>into</em> it.</p>
<p>He dropped the <em>parang</em> and lunged, his arms wide, as if to
embrace the storm. He plunged into the heart of the swirling form.</p>
<p>There was no sound of impact. There was a sound of
<em>unraveling</em>.</p>
<p>Razak’s body stiffened. His head snapped back. His eyes, wide open,
were not looking at the night sky. They were looking at everything at
once. Images began to flicker across his skin, rapid and terrifying: the
face of the old gardener who had taught him to sharpen a
<em>parang</em>, the flight of a hornbill at dawn, the cool touch of the
river stones, the weight of my grandmother’s trust, the taste of salt
from the sea below. His life, his memories, were being ripped from him,
played back on the surface of his own flesh, fed into the vortex.</p>
<p>He was giving it a new dataset. A overwhelming flood of sensation
that was not ordered, not financial, not logical. It was the smell of
rain on hot soil. It was the ache of a long day’s work. It was loyalty,
and place, and a quiet, enduring love for a broken house.</p>
<p>The fragment-father shuddered. The clean, cold line of my father’s
logic wavered, corrupted by this sudden, immense infusion of
<em>life</em>. It was a denial-of-service attack, delivered with a human
body.</p>
<p>Razak’s voice, strained but clear, cut through the psychic noise.
“NOW, SAYA!”</p>
<p>He was sacrificing his past to buy me a present.</p>
<p>Tears blurred my vision. I fumbled in the pocket of my jeans. My
fingers closed around the cold, familiar shape: the old Zippo lighter
I’d carried since university, engraved with a meaningless crest. A habit
from a different life.</p>
<p>I flicked the wheel.</p>
<p>The tiny, real, perfect flame sprang to life, a defiant sun in that
place of stolen memory.</p>
<p>I looked at Razak, locked in his fatal embrace with the thing. Our
eyes met. In his, there was no fear. There was only a fierce, final
instruction.</p>
<p>I dropped the lighter.</p>
<p>The world did not explode. It <em>ignited</em>.</p>
<p>The flame touched the river of fuel and became a line of racing fire,
a brilliant, hungry serpent that slithered across the concrete and into
the shed. For a heartbeat, there was silence. Then the fire found the
drums.</p>
<p>The blast was a solid thing. It picked me up and threw me backward
out of the doorway, into the mud and rock. Heat, a physical wall, roared
over me. The shed ceased to be a structure and became an origin point
for light and fury. The corrugated iron roof became a wing of flame,
peeling back and soaring into the sky.</p>
<p>Inside the heart of the fire, two figures were silhouetted.</p>
<p>One was Razak, standing tall.</p>
<p>The other was the fragment-father, its form distending, stretching
like taffy, as the pure, consuming reality of the fire—a thing with no
memory, only a present-tense hunger—met its borrowed existence.</p>
<p>The thing screamed. It was the house screaming, the server screaming,
my father screaming. It was the sound of a wound being cauterized.</p>
<p>Then the scream was swallowed by the roar of the fire, and the
silhouette of the man was swallowed by the silhouette of the storm, and
together, they were swallowed by the light.</p>
<p>I lay on the ground, the breath knocked from me, my face seared by
the heat. I watched the shed burn. I watched it burn until the fuel was
gone and the fire settled into a sullen, crackling consumption of wood
and wire. I watched until the roof collapsed in a shower of sparks that
were carried away by the wind, toward the sea.</p>
<p>When I could move, I pushed myself to my knees. My ears rang. The
world was silent but for the crackle of dying flame and the eternal sigh
of the sea.</p>
<p>Razak was gone. Truly gone. Not even a shadow remained.</p>
<p>The fragment-father was gone. The air no longer wept silver-black. It
smelled of smoke, petrol, and a strange, clean emptiness.</p>
<p>I stood on shaky legs. The promontory was just a rock again. The
cliff was just a cliff. The jungle was just a jungle, digesting the
night.</p>
<p>I had come here to inherit a house. I had unleashed a ghost. I had
watched an ally offer his entire history as a weapon. I had burned a
shed to burn a idea.</p>
<p>I was the heir. And all I had inherited was a vacancy.</p>
<p>I walked to the cliff edge. The sea below was black, flecked with the
dying orange reflections of the fire. The boat my father had planned to
use was a scatter of grey splinters on the rocks, where Razak had left
it.</p>
<p>I turned my back on the sea. I looked at the path leading down, back
through the jungle, back to the <em>rumah besar</em>. It was a black
ribbon. The house was still there. Wounded. Silent. Empty of its
artificial ghost, but not of its real ones. Not of my grandmother. Not
of Razak. Not of me.</p>
<p>The solicitor’s key was still in my pocket. It was cold.</p>
<p>The ordinary world was out there, beyond the jungle, beyond the
gates. A world of banks and deadlines and quiet rooms where my father’s
absence would now become a legal fact. A world that had no grammar for
screaming stone or sacrificial memory.</p>
<p>I could walk down this mountain, get in my car, and drive to that
world. I could let the lawyers fight over the ashes. I could let the
house stand as a ruin, a monument to a finished nightmare.</p>
<p>But the house was not finished. It was digesting. It had digested the
rain. It had digested a ghost. It had digested a good man.</p>
<p>And I had left something inside it.</p>
<p>The server. The cold, silent heart of the machine. It was still in
the study, dark now, its signal dead. A corpse of data. But corpses
could be read. Corpses could tell stories. My father’s story. The story
of what he had built, and who he had built it for. The story of the
wound he had tried to monetize.</p>
<p>The knowledge was a poison. It was also a weapon. A final, terrible
asset.</p>
<p>Razak had died to keep it from becoming something else. He had died
to give me a choice.</p>
<p>I looked at the burning shed, a pyre for two kinds of ghost. Then I
looked down the dark path.</p>
<p>The heir was gone. The witness remained.</p>
<p>I picked up the fallen flashlight from where it had rolled,
miraculously unbroken. Its beam was weaker now, the battery fading. It
cut a shallow, yellow path through the drifting smoke.</p>
<p>I did not turn toward the car. I did not turn toward the world that
made sense.</p>
<p>I took a breath that tasted of fire and salt and memory.</p>
<p>And I started walking back down the path, back into the throat of the
jungle, back toward the house that was waiting, silent and hungry, to
see what I would become.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-8-1">CHAPTER 8</h2>
<p>The world of banks was a different kind of digestion.</p>
<p>It happened in a room the colour of bone, in a building that drank
sound with double-glazed glass and deep-pile carpet, not with iron-hard
wood. The air was the temperature of nothing, smelling of recycled
oxygen and a faint, citrus-tinged cleaner meant to evoke sterility, not
life. It was a place designed for the management of absence. I sat in a
leather chair that did not sigh under my weight, facing a wide desk of
pale, polished oak. A man in a suit the grey of a dove’s underbelly sat
behind it. His name was Mr. Tan. He was the solicitor’s superior, a
partner. The envelope with the key had come from him.</p>
<p>On the desk between us lay two objects. The first was a sealed
affidavit, signed by a doctor in a Kuala Lumpur hospital, attesting to
the death of one Razak bin Hassan, cause of death: traumatic injury
sustained in a structural fire. The second was a small, black,
featureless rectangle of metal and silicon: the solid-state drive I had
wrenched from the dead server’s heart in the <em>rumah besar</em> study,
its housing still faintly smudged with soot and my own sweat.</p>
<p>“The probate of your father’s estate is, of course, uncontested,”
Mr. Tan was saying. His voice was a dry, precise instrument. It did not
echo. It was absorbed, like everything else in this room. “The transfer
of the land title for the Batu Talam property is straightforward,
pending the usual surveys. The fire damage to the outbuilding is
regrettable, but covered. The main structure appears… intact.”</p>
<p>He paused, his eyes flicking from the affidavit to the drive. He had
not touched either. They were contaminants in his sterile field.</p>
<p>“This,” he said, indicating the drive with a minimal tilt of his
chin, “is not part of the estate’s assets. Nor is the… incident detailed
here.” He meant Razak’s death. He had called it an ‘incident’. A
structural fire. He had accepted the affidavit, the official story, with
the relieved air of a man handed a correct receipt. It was a grammar he
understood.</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. My own voice sounded strange here. Rougher. It had
a grain to it, like the <em>belian</em> wood, that this room could not
soften. “They’re mine.”</p>
<p>“Your personal effects, certainly.” He steepled his fingers. “The
estate, however, carries certain… contingent liabilities. Your father’s
research company. Its intellectual property holdings are nebulous. There
are potential creditors. Speculative investors who provided seed capital
for projects that never… materialized.”</p>
<p>He was talking around the wound. The wound my father had tried to
monetize. The haunting as a service. The screaming stone, packaged and
sold. These men in their dove-grey suits were the other end of that
transaction. They were not believers. They were facilitators. They
digested risk, and profit, and tragedy, and turned it all into columns
on a spreadsheet. Their hunger was quiet, air-conditioned, and
limitless.</p>
<p>“What do they want?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A resolution,” Mr. Tan said. “Closure. The assets are one thing. The
<em>potential</em> of the assets is another. It creates an… unsettled
ledger. Your father was a visionary, but his records were…
idiosyncratic. If there were any remaining prototypes, data
repositories, code pertaining to his sensory immersion projects… they
would be considered part of the company’s residual portfolio. Of
significant value to the creditors.”</p>
<p>He looked at the drive again. A quiet, professional hunger in his
gaze.</p>
<p>This was the test. Not of courage, but of citizenship. Could I
re-enter the ordinary world? Could I speak its language? Could I hand
over this piece of poisoned, sacred memory and let it become an asset, a
line item, the seed of some future, sanitized horror in a lab or a
boardroom? I could walk out of this room with the title to the land,
with a cleared bank account, with no legal entanglements. I could let
the house stand. I could let the story end. The world of banks would
digest it all, and I would be clean.</p>
<p>I thought of the <em>rumah besar</em>, silent in the jungle. Not
finished. Digesting. I thought of Razak’s face in the firelight, his
choice. He had not died to give me a clean exit. He had died to give me
a weapon.</p>
<p>I leaned forward. The leather of the chair creaked, a small, animal
sound in the quiet room.</p>
<p>“My father’s research was a failure,” I said, the words cool and
flat. “A dead end. He was chasing a psychological phenomenon, not a
technological one. There are no prototypes. No code. What existed was
tied to a specific location. To the house itself. It’s gone.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tan’s expression did not change. He was a man who listened to
words, but heard balance sheets. “The drive?”</p>
<p>“Personal,” I said. “Letters. Diaries. Family photographs.
Sentimental value only.” I reached out and picked it up. The metal was
cool. It felt heavier than it was. “The creditors are welcome to the
company’s physical assets. The office furniture. The computer shells.
The land. But the intellectual property is a ghost. You can’t monetize a
ghost, Mr. Tan. Not in any court that matters.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence. The air conditioner hummed its single,
sustained note. I held his gaze, letting him see the witness in me. Not
the heir. The heir was a concept he could work with—a title, a transfer.
The witness was something else. The witness had seen the digestion. The
witness knew the cost.</p>
<p>Finally, he gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod. It was not
agreement. It was a tactical retreat. He had probed, found something
solid and unyielding, and withdrawn. The world of banks did not like
mysteries. It liked facts. I had given him a new fact: I was not a
conduit. I was a wall.</p>
<p>“The probate will proceed,” he said, closing a folder on his desk
with a soft, definitive <em>thump</em>. “We will notify you when the
transfers are complete. As for the… personal effects.” He glanced at the
drive in my hand. “I trust you will dispose of them appropriately.”</p>
<p><em>Appropriately</em>. In the world of banks, that meant shredding,
incineration, deletion. A sterile end.</p>
<p>“I will,” I said.</p>
<p>And I knew, as I stood and walked out of the bone-coloured room, that
it was the first true thing I had said.</p>
<hr />
<p>The monsoon had retreated, leaving the city steaming. The pavement
exhaled a damp, grimy heat that clung to the skin. I walked for an hour,
through crowds that moved in streams of purpose, past shops selling
things that were meant to be consumed and replaced. The noise was a
constant, layered roar—engines, music, chatter—a chaos the <em>rumah
besar</em> would have drunk into a sigh. Here, it just accumulated.</p>
<p>I found a small, narrow internet cafe tucked between a money changer
and a fabric shop. It was dark, cave-like, the air thick with the smell
of stale smoke and hot electronics. I paid for a private booth in the
back, a cubicle with a scarred PC and a door that latched.</p>
<p>I plugged in the drive.</p>
<p>It appeared on the screen as a single, unnamed volume. I
double-clicked. A folder opened. Not letters. Not diaries.</p>
<p>It was a architecture. A digital blueprint.</p>
<p>Directory after directory, labeled with my father’s clinical, precise
shorthand. <code>Acoustic_Resonance_Mapping</code>.
<code>Subsonic_Frequency_Generation</code>.
<code>Historical_Emotional_Residue_Cataloguing</code>.
<code>Subject_Response_Logs</code>. Files upon files. Audio waveforms
that looked like seismic readings of a haunted heart. Schematics for the
speakers Razak had shown me, buried in the walls, the floor. Code for
the algorithm that curated the pain, that learned from the subject’s
fear, that made the haunting adaptive. <em>Personalized</em>.</p>
<p>And then, the logs. Entries dated over the last two years.</p>
<p><code>Subject 04: Male, 42. Prime motivator: financial guilt. Resonance with ‘oppressive silence’ motif, 87% efficacy. Reported experience: ‘crushing weight, inability to breathe.’ Subscription tier: Platinum. Renewed.</code></p>
<p><code>Subject 11: Female, 38. Prime motivator: romantic betrayal. Amplified ‘whispering chorus’ module triggered strong recall of specific arguments. Subject terminated session early. Requested refund. Denied per Section 4.3 of service agreement.</code></p>
<p>My father’s notes were dispassionate, analytical. He wrote of
emotional vulnerabilities as ‘access points,’ of traumatic memory as
‘raw material,’ of profound human terror as ‘user engagement metrics.’
He had not just recorded the house’s memory; he had weaponized its
grammar. He had turned my grandmother’s grief, her long, lonely vigil,
into a suite of terrifying effects. He had commodified the stone’s
scream.</p>
<p>Nausea rose in my throat, bitter and hot. This was the wound, laid
bare not in stone or ghost-light, but in clean, readable text. This was
the thing Razak had died to prevent from leaving the mountain. It wasn’t
just the data; it was the manual. With this, someone else could do it.
Find another place of pain. Another hungry silence. And feed it.</p>
<p>I scrolled further, my hand cold on the mouse. There were financial
records. Incoming wires from shell companies, from numbered accounts.
Substantial sums. A list of client codes. A separate, encrypted
directory labeled <code>Partners</code>.</p>
<p>This was the moral test. Not in the jungle, but here, in this plastic
booth, with the glow of the screen on my face. The weapon was in my
hands. I could destroy it. I could follow Mr. Tan’s unspoken advice and
dispose of it ‘appropriately.’ A permanent delete. A hammer taken to the
drive. A cleansing fire.</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>I opened a new browser. I navigated, through a series of anonymizing
relays, to a secure drop-box used by a consortium of investigative
journalists my father had once mentioned in derision, calling them
‘sentimentalists.’ They hunted war criminals, corruption, environmental
crimes. I created a new, untraceable account.</p>
<p>I began to upload.</p>
<p>Not everything. I stripped out the raw code, the technical
schematics—the recipe. I kept the logs. The financial records. The
client codes. The ‘Partner’ directory. I compiled a narrative from my
father’s own cold words, a testament to the crime. The crime was not
against the dead, but against the living. Against the sanctity of a
person’s own pain. It was a theft of memory, an industrialization of
haunting.</p>
<p>I typed a brief, unadorned preface. <em>This is the archive of
Alexander Cheong’s ‘Memory Palace’ project. What you do with it is your
responsibility.</em></p>
<p>I hovered the cursor over the upload button. My heart was a hard,
cold stone in my chest. This was not destruction. This was release. It
was taking the poison and putting it into the water supply of the
ordinary world. It would cause scandals. Ruin careers. Perhaps trigger
investigations. It would be messy, painful, and utterly, devastatingly
public. It would drag my father’s name, and by extension my own, through
a different kind of jungle—one of headlines and legal discovery.</p>
<p>Razak had died to contain this. To bury it with him on the
mountain.</p>
<p>But containment was what the house did. It digested and held. The
world outside did not digest; it disseminated. It fought poison with
exposure, with noise, with the relentless, ugly light of day. It was the
opposite of the <em>rumah besar</em>’s deep, wet sigh.</p>
<p>I thought of my grandmother, sitting in her silence for decades,
holding a memory so heavy it had seeped into the stone. She had
contained it. And in containing it, she had preserved it, allowed it to
fester into something that could be mined.</p>
<p>I did not want to be a container anymore.</p>
<p>I clicked upload.</p>
<p>The progress bar filled, a slow, blue crawl. When it was done, I
securely erased the drive, writing over its memory with random data,
once, twice, three times. I did not destroy it. I made it empty. A
silent, black rectangle. A corpse of data that could tell no stories at
all.</p>
<p>I walked out of the internet cafe into the shocking heat of the
afternoon. The noise of the city felt different. Not a chaos to be
endured, but a cacophony that could drown out a single, screaming
secret. I had thrown the stone into that ocean of sound. The ripples
would spread. The wound was now a public record.</p>
<hr />
<p>The final cleansing was not of the house, but of the world it had
touched.</p>
<p>It began with a phone call, two days later, to a number associated
with one of the client codes—<code>Subject 04</code>, the man haunted by
financial guilt. I used a voice modulator, a simple app. I did not
identify myself. I merely recited, in a flat, digital monotone, a line
from his response log. <em>“I can hear the coins falling, one by one,
into a bottomless well. They are the faces of the people I
ruined.”</em></p>
<p>There was a choked silence on the other end, then a broken, “Who is
this? How do you—?”</p>
<p>“The service has been permanently terminated,” the digital voice
said. “Your data has been destroyed. You are free.”</p>
<p>I hung up. I repeated the process for three others, chosen at random.
A woman who feared the sound of her own child’s laughter. A man who
could not bear the scent of jasmine. I did not offer comfort. I offered
a fact. The machine was broken. The curated ghost was gone. They were
left with only their own, unamplified memories. It was a brutal kind of
mercy.</p>
<p>Then I called the last number. It was not from the client list. It
was from the <code>Partners</code> directory. A Singapore number,
registered to a venture capital firm with a sleek, minimalist name. A
man answered on the second ring. His voice was smooth, expectant.
“Yes?”</p>
<p>“For Alexander Cheong’s partners,” I said, using my own voice now,
stripped of modulation, of affect. “The asset you were funding is null.
The server is ash. The data is in the wild. You have no equity. You have
only liability.”</p>
<p>“Who is this?” The smoothness was gone, replaced by a sharp, metallic
alertness.</p>
<p>“The witness,” I said. And ended the call.</p>
<p>I powered off the phone, removed the SIM card, and broke both in
half. I scattered the pieces in different bins across the city. It was a
small, futile ritual, but rituals mattered. They were the grammar of
endings.</p>
<p>I had applied the lessons of the house. I had identified the
sickness—not the ghost, but the system that sought to exploit it. I had
confronted it not with a flashlight in a dark study, but with truth in
the blinding light of the ordinary world. I had taken the weapon I was
given and I had broken it in public view, ensuring no one could ever
wield it again.</p>
<p>The evil was not in the stone’s scream. The evil was in the desire to
record it, to package it, to sell tickets to another soul’s private
hell. That evil did not live in the <em>rumah besar</em>. It lived in
places like Mr. Tan’s bone-coloured office. It lived in silent wires of
digital capital. I could not cleanse those places. But I could salt the
earth around this one particular venture. I could make it a legend of
failure, of exposure, of catastrophic reputational damage. In the world
of banks, that was a kind of exorcism.</p>
<hr />
<p>I returned to Batu Talam one last time, at dusk.</p>
<p>The jungle path was familiar now. It did not feel like a throat, but
like a corridor in a home I was leaving. The air was clear, holding the
green, damp scent of regrowth. The ashes of the shed were a dark, wet
smear on the earth, already being reclaimed by ferns and creeping moss.
Nature’s digestion, slow and patient.</p>
<p>The <em>rumah besar</em> stood against the darkening sky. It looked
smaller. Not diminished, but settled. The wound in its side—the
shattered study window—was a dark eye. It made no sound. It drank the
fading light.</p>
<p>I did not go inside. The key was still in my pocket. It was no longer
cold. It was just a piece of metal.</p>
<p>I stood on the overgrown lawn, where the ghost of my grandmother had
stood, where Razak had fallen. I was not the heir. I was not the
witness. Those were roles, costumes for the battle. I was just a person
who had inherited a wound and chosen, painfully, not to pass it on, nor
to profit from it, but to expose its mechanics to the air.</p>
<p>I had integrated nothing. I was not reborn whole. I was scarred, and
quiet, and terribly light. The weight of the house’s memory, and my
father’s sin, was no longer mine alone to carry. I had shared it. I had
translated it into a language the ordinary world could, however
clumsily, prosecute. It was the only justice possible.</p>
<p>I took the key from my pocket. I knelt and dug a small hole at the
base of the great <em>belian</em> wood steps, where the wood met the
earth. I placed the key inside. I covered it over. Let the house keep
its teeth. Let the jungle reclaim them in time.</p>
<p>I stood, brushing the soil from my hands. The last of the light bled
from the sky, leaving the house a silhouette. A cut-out against the
starless dark. It was not hungry. It was not waiting. It was just a
house. A beautiful, terrible, empty house.</p>
<p>I turned and walked back up the path, toward the car, toward the
world that made a different, more complicated sense. I did not look
back.</p>
<p>But as I reached the ridge, a sound made me stop. Not a scream. Not a
sigh.</p>
<p>It was the first, tentative chirrup of a night insect. Then another.
Then a chorus. Life, returning to the cleared ground. Not a memory. A
presence.</p>
<p>I got into the car. I started the engine. The headlights cut a path
through the gathering dark. I drove down the mountain, through the
silent gates, and back onto the road that led to the city, to the
future, to a life that was now entirely, irrevocably, my own.</p>
<p>The house was behind me. The story of the house was ahead of me,
spinning out now on digital currents, soon to become headlines, denials,
lawsuits—a noisy, messy, living thing. I had set it free. And in doing
so, I had bound myself to its consequences.</p>
<p>The road unspooled under my tires, a black ribbon leading away from
the jungle. In the rearview mirror, the mountain was a deeper shadow
against the night. And for a fleeting second, just before the bend
swallowed the view, I thought I saw a single, faint, yellow light wink
on in an upstairs window of the <em>rumah besar</em>.</p>
<p>A trick of the eye. A reflection of the moon on glass.</p>
<p>Or a door, closing.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-9-1">CHAPTER 9</h2>
<p>The city was eating the light.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a glare, but a consumption. The afternoon sun hit the glass
towers of the capital, a fierce, blinding hammer-stroke, but where it
touched the older quarters—the shophouses with their peeling stucco, the
clogged arteries of the streets—the light was devoured. The concrete,
stained with exhaust and the breath of eight million people, drank the
brilliance. All that reached me, standing at the window of my borrowed
apartment, was a dull, copper haze, as if the world were exhaling the
last of its heat.</p>
<p>I’d been back a week. The silence from my phone was a new kind of
key, cold and weightless in my pocket. I hadn’t answered it. Not
yet.</p>
<p>The air was the colour of smog and dust, thick with the smell of
frying oil, diesel, and something else—the faint, metallic tang of
anticipation, of a story beginning to ferment. My laptop glowed on the
desk behind me, a square of artificial dawn. The article was live. It
moved through the digital veins of the world, a silent, spreading
stain.</p>
<p>The first response was not a comment, but an absence. The usual
background hum of my life—the messages from acquaintances, the
newsletters, the digital detritus—had stilled. It was the silence of a
forest before a storm, the moment the insects cease their chorus. Then,
the first notification. A ping, soft as a drop of water in a deep well.
Then another. Then a flood.</p>
<p>They were not screams. They were not sighs. They were questions,
shaped like knives.</p>
<p><em>Is this verified?</em> <em>Can you comment on the
allegations?</em> <em>We represent the interests of the T—
family…</em></p>
<p>I turned from the window. The apartment was a shell, rented with the
last of the advance from the journal. White walls, a bed, a desk. A
temporary cell in the hive. It felt less real than the porch of the
caretaker’s cottage, less substantial than the shadow of the <em>rumah
besar</em>. Here, the past was not a presence in the wood; it was a data
stream, a thing to be managed, parsed, denied. A noisy, messy, living
thing. I had set it free. And now it circled back, hunting for me.</p>
<p>My editor, Ravi, had called it the elixir. “You bring it back from
the mountain,” he’d said, his voice crackling down the line from London.
“The bitter medicine. The truth. You force the sick world to swallow
it.” His metaphor was grand, literary. He couldn’t smell the champaca
rot in it, couldn’t feel the <em>belian</em> wood’s refusal to echo. My
elixir was not a golden potion. It was a soil-stained key, buried at the
root of a thing. It was a soundless house, and a single, imagined
light.</p>
<p>The phone rang. Not a number, but a name: <strong>Amina</strong>.</p>
<p>The sound was a hook in my sternum. I watched the screen pulse, a
tiny, frantic heart. She belonged to the before. To the life that had
made sense, the one of gentle career arcs and weekend plans, of a future
that was a straight, well-lit road. She was the ordinary world I had
left to go to the mountain. I had not spoken to her since my return.
What words existed in the space between <em>How was your trip?</em> and
<em>I have dismantled my father’s memory and may have started a legal
war</em>?</p>
<p>The ringing stopped. The silence it left was deeper, more
personal.</p>
<p>This, then, was the return. Not a hero’s welcome, but a reckoning
with the air you used to breathe, now found to be thin, insufficient.
The journey had not ended when I drove away. It had simply changed
terrain.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 1: The protagonist returns to their community or
ordinary life, bearing the reward (the elixir) that can heal or improve
it.</strong></p>
<p>The café was a mimicry of comfort. All exposed brick and curated
plants, the smell of single-origin coffee a poor substitute for the
petrichor of the highlands. It was where Amina and I used to meet, a
neutral ground in the city’s sprawl. A place for the ordinary.</p>
<p>She was already there, at our usual corner table. Seeing her was like
looking at a photograph of myself from a year ago. She was crisp where I
felt frayed, solid where I felt spectral. She smiled, a careful,
practiced curve of her lips that didn’t reach her eyes. They were
already scanning me, diagnosing the changes.</p>
<p>“You look thin,” she said, after the brittle hug. “The mountain air
didn’t agree with you?”</p>
<p>“It agreed with some parts,” I said, my voice sounding strange to me,
like I was speaking from the bottom of a well. “Other parts, it
digested.”</p>
<p>She blinked, unsure if it was a joke. I hadn’t meant it as one. We
ordered. The ritual of it—milk options, syrup choices—felt absurd, a
frantic dance on the edge of a precipice.</p>
<p>“So,” she began, stirring her latte with precise, surgical motions.
“You’re back. For good?”</p>
<p>“I’m back.”</p>
<p>“And the house? The estate?”</p>
<p>“It’s settled. In a manner of speaking.”</p>
<p>She nodded, absorbing the non-answer. Amina was a corporate lawyer.
She dealt in defined terms, in clauses and resolutions. My vagueness was
a fog bank on her clear charts. “I’m glad. It must be a relief to have
it done. To be free of it.”</p>
<p><em>I am not free of it</em>, I thought. <em>I have swallowed it
whole. It lives in me now.</em> I said, “It’s different now.”</p>
<p>The silence stretched. She took a sip, leaving a perfect lipstick
mark on the rim. A stamp of normalcy. “I read your piece,” she said
finally, her voice lowered, though no one in the café knew us.</p>
<p>Ah. There it was. The elixir, presented not in a chalice, but in a
shared link. The thing I had brought back.</p>
<p>“It’s… powerful,” she said, choosing the word like one might select a
safe tool to handle a radioactive object. “The writing is incredible.
But, Jesus. The allegations. The documents. Is it… wise?”</p>
<p>“Wise?”</p>
<p>“To publish that. With names. With proof. Your family name is on it,
too. It’s on you now, as much as it’s on him.”</p>
<p>“It always was on me,” I said. “I just didn’t know the shape of the
weight.”</p>
<p>She leaned forward, her lawyer-face settling into place, the face of
strategy. “Listen. I’m not talking about morality. I’m talking about
consequence. Defamation suits. Harassment. The T— family isn’t just
going to let this lie. They have tentacles. This isn’t a jungle ghost
story. This is real life.”</p>
<p>“That’s the point,” I said, and my own voice surprised me with its
flat calm. “To make it real. To take it out of the realm of whispers and
sighs and put it in a room with fluorescent lights and a court reporter.
That’s the elixir. It’s not a cure. It’s an exposure.”</p>
<p>She sat back, her eyes wide with a kind of professional horror. She
saw the cost-benefit analysis, and the costs were towering, red,
incalculable. “And what does it heal, exactly? A dead man’s reputation?
A historical wrong? Who does this medicine actually help?”</p>
<p>“The truth doesn’t heal,” I said, repeating something the old
solicitor had muttered, a lifetime ago in his dusty office. “It just
stops the infection from growing in the dark.”</p>
<p>“It makes you a target,” she whispered fiercely.</p>
<p>I looked at her—beautiful, concerned, anchored in the world of
precedent and precedent. My community. My ordinary world. And I
understood I could not make her drink from the same cup. The elixir was
mine alone. To share it was to offer a burden, not a blessing.</p>
<p>“I know,” I said.</p>
<p>The conversation stuttered on, finding safer grooves: mutual friends,
a new restaurant, the city’s infernal traffic. But a fissure had opened
in the table between us, a crack as deep as the one between the
<em>rumah besar</em> and the caretaker’s cottage. We were speaking
across a divide. I had returned from the mountain, but I had brought the
mountain’s weather back with me. She was still living in the old
climate.</p>
<p>When we parted, the hug was even more brittle. “Take care of
yourself,” she said, and it sounded like a eulogy.</p>
<p>“You too.”</p>
<p>I watched her walk away, her heels clicking a firm, definite rhythm
on the pavement. A sound that knew its destination. I turned and walked
in the opposite direction, into the copper haze. The elixir was not a
gift for my community. It was a separation. A line drawn. The first step
in healing a sick system is often to be expelled from it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 2: They are recognized for their journey and
transformation, their status changed forever.</strong></p>
<p>The recognition came not with a crown, but with a byline.</p>
<p>My name, which had always been a quiet, personal thing—a daughter’s
name, a granddaughter’s name, a lover’s name—was now a public symbol. It
sat beneath the headline, a small, stark declaration of authorship. Of
accusation.</p>
<p>The article was not just read; it was replicated, dissected,
amplified. It jumped from the niche literary journal to the mainstream
press. “A Daughter’s Reckoning.” “The Ghost in the Plantation.”
“Unearthing a Colonial Sin.” My prose was trimmed into soundbites, my
metaphors stripped for parts. The house became a “mansion,” the silence
a “cover-up,” the memory a “legacy of corruption.”</p>
<p>My status changed not in a ceremony, but in the digital reflection.
My inbox became a tribunal. There were messages of thanks, raw and
trembling, from strangers who saw their own buried family histories in
mine. There were vicious denunciations, calling me a traitor to my
class, a fabricator, a pawn in some larger political game. There were
offers—for interviews, for book deals, for speaking engagements. My
quiet life as a translator, a ghost for other people’s words, was over.
I had become a source.</p>
<p>Ravi called again, his voice now brimming with a frenetic energy.
“It’s a storm! A beautiful, terrible storm! You’ve done it. You’ve
crossed over.”</p>
<p>“Crossed over to what?”</p>
<p>“To being a <em>voice</em>. A witness. Your next piece—we need to
talk about your next piece. The follow-up. The personal cost. The
emotional journey.”</p>
<p>He was already building the narrative of my transformation, packaging
the elixir for wider distribution. I was no longer just the bearer; I
was to become the story itself. The thought was nauseating. I had
translated the house’s memory to escape being consumed by it. Now, the
world wanted to consume my translation, and me along with it.</p>
<p>The most profound recognition, however, came in an envelope. Thick,
cream, formal. The return address was a law firm whose name was
synonymous with old money and impenetrable power. The T— family’s first
move.</p>
<p>It was not a lawsuit. Not yet. It was a letter. A masterpiece of
polite menace. It acknowledged the publication of “certain fictionalized
and defamatory assertions.” It expressed “profound disappointment” at my
“exploitation of a family’s private grief and complex history.” It urged
me, “in the interest of all parties, and to avoid further unnecessary
distress,” to issue a full retraction and a public apology.</p>
<p>It was a map of the battlefield, drawn on vellum. They were not
denying the house. They were denying my right to speak its language.
They were asserting ownership over the narrative, as they had once
asserted ownership over the land and the lives upon it.</p>
<p>I held the paper. It smelled of expensive ink and ambition. This was
my new status: a defendant in waiting. A name on a docket. A problem to
be solved.</p>
<p>I did not feel like a hero. I felt like the <em>belian</em> wood
step, bearing a new, different weight. The recognition was not an
accolade; it was a gravity. It pulled at me, defining my orbit from now
on. I had traded the house’s haunting for the world’s gaze. Both were
forms of hunger.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 3: The elixir is shared or used, demonstrating the
tangible benefit of the protagonist’s journey to others.</strong></p>
<p>The benefit was not a parade. It was a connection, silent and
subterranean.</p>
<p>A week after the letter, a message arrived. Not through the public
channels, but through a secure, encrypted service Ravi had insisted I
set up. The subject line was blank. The body contained only a set of
geographical coordinates and a time: two days from now, 3 p.m.</p>
<p>I knew, with a certainty that felt lodged in my bones, what it was.
Who it might be from. The elixir, working.</p>
<p>I took a train out of the city, then a rattling bus into the
plantation belts of the next state. The landscape was a tamer echo of
the highlands—neat, endless rows of oil palm, a geometric green desert.
The coordinates led to a small, forgotten town, a place where the dust
seemed permanent. A roadside <em>kopitiam</em>, its plastic chairs
cracked, its tables stained with decades of coffee rings.</p>
<p>I sat at the back, facing the door. I ordered a <em>teh tarik</em>
and watched the milky tea swirl in the glass. At 3 p.m. precisely, an
old man entered. He was slight, his back curved like a question mark,
his skin a map of sun and time. He moved with a painful slowness. His
eyes, however, were quick, darting across the room before settling on
me. He knew. He walked over, lowered himself into the chair opposite
with a soft groan. He did not order.</p>
<p>For a long minute, we sat in silence. The sounds of the
<em>kopitiam</em>—the clink of glasses, the murmur of Malay, the distant
fry-sizzle—filled the space between us. He was examining me, not with
hostility, but with a profound, weary caution.</p>
<p>“You wrote the story,” he said finally. His voice was a dry leaf
rustling.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He nodded, a slow, deep movement. “My father,” he said, the words
heavy as stones. “He worked the land. The land in your story. For your
grandfather. Then for your father.”</p>
<p>The air left my lungs. Here was the other side of the key. The lock
it was meant to fit.</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” I said, the words utterly inadequate.</p>
<p>He waved a gnarled hand, dismissing the apology. It was not what he
came for. “We knew. Of course we knew. The stories passed down. The
missing ones. The wages that never came. The fear.” He looked into his
own hands, folded on the table. “But it was our story. A private hurt. A
family hurt. To speak it was… dangerous. It was to invite the hunger
back.”</p>
<p><em>The hunger.</em> He used the word without having read my piece,
without knowing my metaphor. He knew the true shape of the thing.</p>
<p>“Why now?” I asked softly.</p>
<p>His old eyes met mine. In them, I saw not gratitude, but a grim,
settled recognition. “You made it a public hurt. You have the name. You
have the papers. You took the private ghost and put it in the daylight.
Now, it is their ghost too.” He meant the T— family, the world, the
record. “It is harder to deny a ghost in daylight. It has a shadow
others can see.”</p>
<p>He reached into the pocket of his worn shirt and pulled out a small,
folded piece of newsprint. It was my article, carefully cut out. He
unfolded it, his fingers trembling. He pointed to a paragraph, to the
lines where I had described the ledger entries, the cold accounting of
human life.</p>
<p>“This name,” he whispered, his finger tapping the newsprint. “This is
my uncle. He was a boy. He went to the house one day with a message. He
did not come back. We were told he ran away. To the city. We knew it was
the hunger.”</p>
<p>I looked at the name, a string of letters I had transcribed from a
crumbling page. To me, it had been evidence. A data point in an
argument. To this man, it was a uncle. A boy. A missing piece of his own
heart.</p>
<p>“What was his name?” I asked. “His real name? The one you called
him?”</p>
<p>The old man’s eyes glistened. He spoke a name, soft and musical, a
name that belonged to the earth and the trees, not to a ledger. I
repeated it. The sound felt sacred in the grimy <em>kopitiam</em>.</p>
<p>“He existed,” the old man said, a statement of fact, of reclamation.
“You put his stolen name in the book. Now I give you his true name. So
you know what you are counting.”</p>
<p>He refolded the article, tucked it back into his pocket. The elixir,
shared. It had not brought his uncle back. It had not given him justice.
It had given him a fragment of his story back, placed in a ledger of
record where it could not be so easily erased. It had given him a
witness. It had given the ghost a shadow.</p>
<p>He stood up, the chair scraping. “It is not over,” he said. “The
hunger has many faces. Now it will look at you.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>He gave one last, slow nod, a transfer of something immense and
unspoken. Then he turned and walked out, back into the glare, his slight
frame soon swallowed by the dusty light.</p>
<p>I sat there, my tea gone cold. The benefit was tangible, and it was
devastating. It was the weight of a true name. It was the confirmation
that the story was not just mine, not just my father’s. It was a
tapestry of stolen lives, and I had pulled one thread into the light.
The elixir was not a cure. It was an acknowledgment. A shared burden.
For the first time, I felt the true scale of what I had carried down the
mountain. It was not a trophy. It was a covenant.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Scene 4: The protagonist finds a new balance and purpose in
their ordinary world, which is now improved.</strong></p>
<p>The new balance was not peace. It was a tense, humming equilibrium,
like the moment after a heavy door has shut, and the echo still lives in
the wood.</p>
<p>I did not retract. I did not apologize. Through Ravi’s paper, I
issued a single, succinct statement: “The story stands. The documents
are authentic. I welcome any discussion of the facts in the appropriate
forums.”</p>
<p>The world shifted around this fixed point. The interview requests
grew more insistent. A documentary filmmaker made contact. A small,
brave human rights group offered legal support, anticipating the coming
storm. My old life—the one of quiet translation, of coffee with Amina,
of planning a future that looked like a smooth extension of the past—was
gone. It had been improved not by becoming happier, but by becoming
true. It was now aligned, painfully, with the reality I had
unearthed.</p>
<p>I moved out of the temporary apartment. I rented a small, top-floor
room in an old shophouse, in a part of the city that had not yet been
polished smooth. From my window, I could see a tangled patch of jungle,
a stubborn remnant clinging to a railway verge. It was not the mountain,
but it was green, and it fought for its place in the concrete world.</p>
<p>My purpose was no longer to decipher other people’s words. It was to
steward my own. To protect the story. To be ready.</p>
<p>I began to write again, not for publication, but for myself. I wrote
about the old man in the <em>kopitiam</em>. I wrote about the true name
of the boy. I wrote about the feel of the soil as I buried the key. I
was building a new interior, a room within myself to house the memory,
now that it was loose in the world. I was learning the language of this
new, complicated sense.</p>
<p>One evening, as the smog-haze turned to a gritty twilight, my phone
rang. An unknown number, local. I let it go to voicemail. A minute
later, a text arrived.</p>
<p><em>It’s David. From the solicitor’s office. Please call me back.
It’s about the house.</em></p>
<p>My blood became a cold river. I waited an hour, watching the green
patch of jungle dissolve into shadow, before I called.</p>
<p>“Thank you for calling back,” David’s voice was tense, stripped of
its professional oil. “There’s been a development. The T— family have
not filed a defamation suit.”</p>
<p>I felt no relief. His tone forbade it.</p>
<p>“What have they done?”</p>
<p>A pause, the rustle of papers. “They’ve invoked a historical land-use
covenant. Arcane, but still technically valid. They are claiming that
the publication of ‘unsubstantiated and damaging narratives’ constitutes
a ‘material detriment’ to the value and legacy of the estate. They are
using it to file for a permanent injunction.”</p>
<p>“An injunction against what?”</p>
<p>“Against you,” he said, the word simple and final. “From speaking,
writing, or publishing any further on the matter of the estate, the
family, or the associated businesses. And… they are seeking a court
order to compel you to return all original documents in your possession
to the estate, as ‘misappropriated family property.’”</p>
<p>The world tilted. They were not trying to argue the truth. They were
trying to legally re-bury it. To silence the voice and reclaim the bones
of the story. To make the ghost private again.</p>
<p>“They can’t do that,” I said, but it sounded like a plea.</p>
<p>“They can try. They have the resources to try for a very, very long
time. This isn’t about winning quickly. It’s about attrition. About
weight.” He sighed. “They want to bury you in process until you are
silent or bankrupt. They want the key back.”</p>
<p>I looked at my hands, clean of mountain soil. They were shaking.
“What do I do?”</p>
<p>“You fight,” he said, and for the first time, I heard a flicker of
the old man’s steel in his voice. “Or you negotiate. But you should
know… they’ve made an offer. A settlement. A substantial financial sum,
in exchange for your full compliance: retraction, apology, return of
documents, and the injunction signed willingly.”</p>
<p>The number he quoted was life-changing. It was freedom from worry, a
new start in a country far away, a return to a kind of ordinary. It was
a bribe to un-know what I knew. To re-enter the quiet, well-lit
road.</p>
<p>“And if I fight?”</p>
<p>“Then you become the story forever. Your life becomes this case. Your
purpose becomes this resistance. There is no guarantee of victory. Only
guarantee of cost.”</p>
<p>I thanked him and told him I would think. I ended the call.</p>
<p>The room was dark now. The city’s lights had come on, a false,
electric constellation against the void. The new balance. The improved
world. It was not a place of rest. It was a battlefield chosen. The
elixir had healed nothing; it had started a war. My purpose was clear:
to be the keeper of the true names. To hold the line between the hunger
and the light.</p>
<p>I would not take the money. I would not return the bones. The key was
buried. Let them dig.</p>
<p>I went to my desk. I opened a new document. The cursor blinked, a
tiny, steady pulse in the darkness. I began to type. Not an article. Not
a defense. A testament. I wrote the true name of the boy. I wrote the
look in the old man’s eyes. I wrote the sound of the first night insect
returning to the cleared ground.</p>
<p>I wrote until the false dawn of the city began to bleed into the sky.
My new ordinary. My new purpose. To remember, and to record. To be the
house that would not swallow the rain, but would let it fall, and fall,
and fall, until it wore even the iron-hard wood away.</p>
<hr />
<p>The knock came at noon.</p>
<p>It was not a friendly sound. It was three sharp, authoritative raps
on the old shophouse door downstairs. I stood at the top of the stairs,
my heart a trapped bird. I heard my landlady’s querulous voice, then a
deeper, formal one.</p>
<p>A moment later, her head appeared at the foot of the stairs, her face
pale. “<em>Sayang</em>,” she said. “There are men. Police, I think. They
ask for you.”</p>
<p>I walked down slowly, each step an age. Two men in plain clothes
stood in the narrow passageway. They held themselves with a stiff,
bureaucratic gravity. One held a folded sheaf of papers.</p>
<p>“Ma’am,” the first one said. “We are here to serve you. A court
order.” He extended the papers.</p>
<p>I took them. The top sheet was dense with legal text. I saw my name.
I saw the words “INJUNCTION” and “COMPELLING RETURN” and “IMMEDIATE
EFFECT.”</p>
<p>“You are required to cease all publication and commentary on the
matters specified,” the second man intoned. “And to present yourself,
with all original documents pertaining to the T— estate, at the offices
of…” He named a firm. The one from the cream-coloured letter. “By 5 p.m.
today.”</p>
<p>The world narrowed to the feel of the paper in my hands. It was
crisp, officious, final. The machinery of the ordinary world, the one
that made complicated sense, was turning. It had found me. It was not
here to debate the truth. It was here to enforce silence.</p>
<p>I looked from their impassive faces to my frightened landlady, to the
slice of dusty street visible through the open door. The road I had
driven down from the mountain had led here, to this threshold.</p>
<p>“I understand,” I heard myself say, my voice distant, calm.</p>
<p>They nodded, turned, and left. The sound of their shoes on the
pavement faded.</p>
<p>I looked down at the order. The hook was not in the next chapter. It
was here, in my hands, in the irrevocable click of a lock turning. The
fight was no longer digital, no longer theoretical. It was on my
doorstep. The house was behind me. The story of the house was ahead of
me, spinning now into the cold, precise gears of the law.</p>
<p>And I had to decide, by 5 p.m., whether to walk into its jaws, or to
vanish into the green, stubborn jungle of the world.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-10-1">CHAPTER 10</h2>
<p>The law was a kind of weather.</p>
<p>It did not rage or weep. It simply arrived, a change in atmospheric
pressure, and you adjusted your life to its new, unyielding climate. The
injunction was a high, cold front, settling over everything. It turned
my words into contraband, my memories into evidence. The silence it
demanded was not the deep, digesting silence of the <em>rumah
besar</em>, but a sterile, procedural hush. A held breath in a
fluorescent-lit room.</p>
<p>I did not vanish into the jungle.</p>
<p>At 4:58 p.m., I presented myself at the offices of the firm named in
the cream-coloured letter. I carried a cardboard box. In it were the
solicitor’s envelope, my grandmother’s brittle journals, the photographs
I had scanned, the maps I had annotated. The physical proof of a story I
was now legally forbidden to tell. The air inside was the temperature of
archived paper, smelling of lemon polish and latent power. A young
associate with eyes like polished river stones took the box without
meeting my gaze. He gave me a receipt. It felt like trading a soul for a
slip of paper.</p>
<p>That was two months ago.</p>
<p>My life now was a study in contraction, in learning the new shape of
the space I was allowed to occupy. The injunction was a glass bell jar
lowered over my existence. I could move, but only in prescribed circles.
I could speak, but only approved words. My online presence was scrubbed,
a digital ghost-town. The fight, as I had known it, was over. The
machinery had ground it to dust.</p>
<p>I settled into a different kind of work. The caretaker’s cottage,
once a base of operations, became simply a home. I paid my landlady rent
from the dwindling remains of my savings, and in the afternoons, I
helped her in the small, sun-baked plot behind the house. We grew bitter
gourd and long beans, chilli and lemongrass. My hands, accustomed to a
keyboard, learned the texture of soil, the stubborn curl of weed roots.
The earth under my nails was a different kind of stain.</p>
<p>“You have a patient touch, <em>sayang</em>,” my landlady said one
day, watching me train a vine onto a bamboo trellis. She no longer
looked frightened. She looked concerned, in a steady, maternal way. The
police had not returned. The law, having stated its terms, receded into
the infrastructure, satisfied.</p>
<p>“It’s just following a pattern,” I said, tying a strip of cloth with
a careful knot.</p>
<p>“That is all anything is,” she replied, watering the base of the
plants with a rusty tin can. “Following the pattern, or breaking
it.”</p>
<p>In the evenings, I began to walk. Not with purpose, but with a
directionless absorption. I traced the lanes of the old town, not as a
researcher hunting clues, but as a ghost learning its haunt. I memorised
the way the last sun caught the moss on a particular wall, the daily
rhythm of a coffee shop, the scent of frying shallots that bloomed at
six. I bought my rice and fish from the same stall, and the woman there
began to set aside the freshest <em>ikan selar</em> for me, a silent,
transactional kindness.</p>
<p>One relationship, however, did not contract. It deepened in the
quiet.</p>
<p>Ariff found me one evening, sitting on the low sea-wall, watching the
fishing boats putter back to harbour. He did not ask about the
injunction, or the box of documents. He simply sat beside me, the
familiar weight of his presence solid against the vast, liquid
horizon.</p>
<p>“They think they have put the story in a cage,” he said after a long
while, his voice barely louder than the lap of water on stone.</p>
<p>“They have.”</p>
<p>“No.” He shook his head, a slow, definite motion. “They have put the
<em>noise</em> in a cage. The argument. The proof. The story…” He tapped
his temple, then his chest. “The story is a root. It grows in the dark.
Without permission.”</p>
<p>I looked at him. His face was calm, etched by the salt and sun of a
life lived on the water’s edge. He was not a man of metaphors, but of
facts. To him, this was fact.</p>
<p>“What does it grow into, Ariff?” I asked, the question sounding
hollow, tired.</p>
<p>He smiled, a rare, full thing that cracked his weathered features
open. “A tree, <em>lah</em>. What else? You cannot see it yet. You are
still underground. But you are growing. I can see it.”</p>
<p>He began to tell me, then, not the grand narratives of history, but
the small, specific stories of place. The corner where a famous
<em>wayang</em> puppeteer had collapsed and died mid-performance, his
spirit said to still murmur the dialogues on windy nights. The reason a
particular stretch of road always flooded, not because of poor drains,
but because it had been a stream, long ago, and water remembers. He
spoke of his own father, a fisherman who could read the mood of the sea
by the taste of the air, a knowledge no sonar could replicate and which
died with him.</p>
<p>I listened. I did not record. I did not take notes. I let the stories
seep into me, not as data points, but as a kind of sustenance. I was
building a different archive, one of lived memory, of identity written
not in documents but in the grain of daily life. The injunction owned
the facts. It could not own this.</p>
<hr />
<p>The monsoon returned, not with the violent inaugural fury of my first
night, but with a weary, persistent dedication. The rain was a grey
veil, day after day.</p>
<p>I found myself drawn, not to the bustling town, but up the winding
road toward the mountain. I never turned into the estate drive. I would
park my borrowed scooter a mile down the road and walk, hood pulled up
against the drizzle, until I could see the gap in the trees where the
iron gates stood.</p>
<p>I did not go to trespass. I went to listen.</p>
<p>Standing there on the public road, the rain hissing in the jungle
canopy, I would feel it. The deep, wet sigh of the <em>rumah besar</em>
drinking the weather. It was the same sound from my first night, but I
heard it differently now. Before, it had been a sound of consumption, of
a secret being held. Now, I heard it as a rhythm. The house was not
eating the rain; it was breathing with it. In, and out. A vast, wooden
lung.</p>
<p>It was during one of these vigils that the fundamental shift
occurred. Not as a dramatic revelation, but as a quiet, interior
collapse and reformation.</p>
<p>I was thinking of my grandmother. Not of her mystery, or her pain, or
the historical weight she carried. I was thinking of her hands. I had no
photograph of them, but I could suddenly feel the memory of their
texture—the papery skin, the surprising strength in the fingers, the
specific way her knuckles looked when she held a teacup. I remembered
the smell of her, not the champaca and clove of her perfume, but the
deeper scent of her skin, like sun-warmed linen and green sap. A private
smell.</p>
<p>And with that, a dam broke. Not a dam of tears, but of
understanding.</p>
<p>I had been trying to <em>solve</em> her. To pin her to the board of
history like a specimen, to explain her choices with the blunt tools of
politics and trauma. I had wanted her truth to be a weapon, to be a key
that unlocked the official story and proved it false. In doing so, I had
made her a symbol. I had, in my own way, been as reductive as the law
that now silenced me.</p>
<p>But she was not a symbol. She was a woman who had loved a house, and
then left it. Who had known a man, and then lost him. Who had carried a
child, and then a grief, and then a life of quiet adaptation in a
distant country. Her identity was not a puzzle to be solved; it was a
song that had been sung, a pattern that had been lived. The facts were
just the sheet music. The truth was in the timbre of the voice, the
breath between the notes, the silent, resonant memory in the bones of
the singer.</p>
<p>The rain soaked through my jacket. I stood on the road, and I let her
be human. Small, and specific, and utterly, magnificently unreachable in
her entirety. My quest to expose her had been a failure. My quest to
<em>know</em> her, however, was not. I knew her now in the way one knows
the shape of a favourite bowl in the dark, or the particular sigh of a
familiar house. I knew her in my cells.</p>
<p>The hook of the story was not in the next chapter of my
investigation. It had been in me all along. The law had come to enforce
silence, and in that imposed silence, I had finally heard the thing I
needed to hear: my own memory, speaking not in facts, but in the
language of felt life.</p>
<p>I turned my back on the gates and walked back to the scooter. The
weight I left on that muddy roadside was not the weight of the
injunction. It was the weight of a wrong question. I felt lighter, and
older, and strangely peaceful.</p>
<hr />
<p>A week later, a different kind of letter arrived. It was not
official. It was handwritten on thick, cream paper, slipped under my
door. The script was elegant, spidery.</p>
<p><em>You have been respectful in your silence. The house has noticed.
There is something you should see. Come alone, to the kitchen entrance,
at sunset tomorrow.</em></p>
<p>It was not signed. It did not need to be.</p>
<p>My heart did not race. A calmness settled over me, the same calm I
had felt taking the injunction papers. This was not a summons to battle.
It was an invitation to a viewing. I had passed some unspoken test. I
had stopped trying to break the door down, and had instead learned to
listen at the keyhole. Now, the door was being opened, just a crack.</p>
<p>The next evening, I told my landlady I was going for a longer walk.
She nodded, her eyes soft with unasked questions. I drove the scooter up
the mountain as the sky bled through shades of orange and purple. I
parked well down the road and approached on foot, the chorus of evening
insects building to a crescendo around me.</p>
<p>The kitchen entrance was at the back of the <em>rumah besar</em>, a
lower, less formal door of the same ironwood. As the last sliver of sun
vanished behind the mountain ridge, the door opened inward. No one
appeared. A rectangle of soft, golden lamplight spilled onto the wet
flagstones.</p>
<p>I stepped inside.</p>
<p>I was in a large, old-fashioned kitchen. A blackened range stood
cold. Shelves held empty jars. The air was still, cool, fragrant with
the ghost of woodsmoke and spices. An old woman stood by a heavy wooden
table. She was small, bent like a wind-shaped tree, her hair a cloud of
white. Her face was a map of deep lines, but her eyes were bright, sharp
as chips of flint. She wore a simple, faded <em>baju kurung</em>.</p>
<p>She looked at me, and I saw in her gaze a century of sunrises, of
watched paths, of silent observation.</p>
<p>“You look like her,” she said. Her voice was the sound of dry leaves
rustling. “Around the eyes. The way you hold your mouth when you are
thinking.”</p>
<p>“You knew my grandmother,” I said. It was not a question.</p>
<p>“I was the cook’s daughter. Then I was the cook. Now, I am the
memory.” She gestured for me to follow. “This way. It is not in the main
house.”</p>
<p>She led me through a scullery, out a back door, and across a narrow,
covered walkway to the old servants’ quarters—the row of rooms with the
corrugated tin roof. She stopped before the last door, the one farthest
from the big house. From her pocket, she produced an old, tarnished key
and unlocked it.</p>
<p>The room was bare, save for a single wooden chair and a trunk in the
centre of the floor. The trunk was old, leather-bound with brass
fittings, dust lying thick on its lid.</p>
<p>“This was his room,” the old woman said. “The gardener. The one she
loved. After he was gone, she came here. Not to the big house. Here. She
left this. She said one day, someone with her eyes would come for it. We
have been waiting.”</p>
<p>She placed the key in my hand. It was warm from her pocket. “The
house keeps its promises,” she whispered, and then she turned and left,
her footsteps silent on the boards. I heard the outer door click
shut.</p>
<p>I was alone in the tiny room. The sound of the jungle night was loud
through the thin walls. I knelt before the trunk. The key fit smoothly.
The lock turned with a well-oiled <em>clunk</em> that echoed in the
emptiness.</p>
<p>I lifted the lid.</p>
<p>There were no journals. No letters. No photographs or maps or legal
documents.</p>
<p>Inside, carefully folded, was a man’s work shirt, faded and patched.
Beneath it, a pair of worn gardening trousers. A small, hand-carved
wooden bird, its paint faded. A shell, smooth and white, from a distant
beach. A bottle of dried frangipani blossoms, their colour long since
bleached to a pale gold. A single, tarnished silver bracelet.</p>
<p>At the very bottom, wrapped in a piece of soft, old cloth, was a
bundle of seeds. Dozens of them, small and dark and hard as pebbles.</p>
<p>This was not an archive. It was a shrine. A collection of
touchstones. The physical evidence of a love that had existed not in
grand gestures or documented declarations, but in the quiet, daily
currency of a shared glance, a gift of a shell, the smell of a work
shirt, the hope contained in a seed. This was the truth the official
records could never capture, the truth the injunction could never
silence. It was the truth of a hand held in the dark, of a private joke,
of a future imagined in the humble form of a garden that was never
planted.</p>
<p>I picked up the wooden bird. Its carving was clumsy, tender. I held
the shell to my ear. I heard the ocean, yes, but also the echo of a
specific day, a specific laugh now lost to time. I understood. My
grandmother had not left this trunk as evidence for a historical
reckoning. She had left it as a message in a bottle for a heart that
would understand its language. A heart that knew that identity is not
just <em>what</em> you are, but <em>who</em> you have loved, and
how.</p>
<p>I sat back on my heels, the objects arranged around me. The fight was
over. The story, in the way I had wanted to tell it, was dead. But here,
in this dust-filled room, something else was alive. A legacy not of
scandal or justice, but of tenderness. A memory not meant for the world,
but for a single, rightful heir.</p>
<p>I had come to the house seeking a weapon. I had found, instead, an
inheritance.</p>
<hr />
<p>I did not take the trunk. I locked it again, leaving its treasures
where they had been kept safe for decades. The truth in that room was
too fragile for the open air. It belonged to the sighing wood and the
watchful silence.</p>
<p>The old woman was gone when I let myself out. The night was full and
deep, the stars sharp pinpricks in the velvet sky. I walked back to the
scooter, the key to the trunk now on my own ring, next to the cold,
legal one.</p>
<p>My life did not change in any outward way. I still helped my landlady
in the garden. I still bought my fish from the same stall. The
injunction still stood, a glass wall between me and public speech.</p>
<p>But inside, the landscape was utterly new. I had a purpose now, but
it was a quiet one. In the evenings, I began to clear a small, neglected
patch of land behind my landlady’s house, a spot that caught the morning
sun. I turned the hard earth, mixed in compost, built a low border from
found stones.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Ariff appeared, watching me work. He saw the careful
rows I had marked in the soil.</p>
<p>“What will you plant here, <em>sayang</em>?” he asked.</p>
<p>I reached into my pocket and took out my closed fist. I opened it. On
my palm lay a few of the small, dark, hard seeds from the trunk.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said, truthfully. “Something that belonged to
her.”</p>
<p>He nodded, as if this was the most sensible thing in the world. “Good
soil here. It will remember what to do.”</p>
<p>I planted the seeds the next morning, pressing each one into the warm
earth with a silent, unspoken blessing. I watered them not with any
expectation, but with a kind of faith. The story was not mine to tell
anymore. But it was mine to tend. To cultivate in the dark, silent soil,
and see what, if anything, chose to grow.</p>
<p>A new kind of patience settled in me. I was no longer a hunter. I was
a gardener. My weapon was a trowel. My battlefield was a square of
earth. My victory would be a green shoot, breaking the surface into the
light, a quiet, stubborn testament to a love that the world had tried to
erase. It would be a legacy written not in words, but in leaf and vine
and flower—a living, breathing memory, pushing its way, against all
odds, into the present.</p>
<p>And as I washed the dirt from my hands at the end of the day, I
looked toward the mountain, and I knew. The house was not a secret to be
solved. It was a companion in silence. And I, its unlikely caretaker,
its quiet gardener, had finally come home.</p>
<hr />
<p>The first shoot appeared three weeks later. A frail, green curl,
unfurling in the dawn light with a shocking, vulnerable courage. I sat
beside it, not touching, just watching. My landlady brought me a cup of
sweet tea and stood with her hand on my shoulder, saying nothing.</p>
<p>That evening, another letter came. Not handwritten, but printed. A
formal, polite email to an account I rarely checked. It was from the
associate with the river-stone eyes. The subject line read:
<em>Regarding Matter T— / Potential Dissolution of Injunction – Without
Prejudice.</em></p>
<p>I read it once. Then I closed the laptop. I went outside and sat in
the growing dark beside my tiny garden. The jungle hummed its ancient
song. The <em>rumah besar</em>, miles away, would be drinking the night
mist, breathing its slow, wooden breath.</p>
<p>The legal machinery was shifting. A gear was turning, perhaps
offering a return to the world of noise and argument. A chance to speak
again.</p>
<p>I looked at the fragile green shoot, a secret breaking ground. I
listened to the deep, remembering silence of the land around me.</p>
<p>And I knew, with a certainty that was as hard and real as the seeds
in my pocket, that my answer would not be found in a lawyer’s office. It
was growing, right here, in the dark, patient soil.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-11-1">CHAPTER 11</h2>
<p>The garden was learning the sun.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a growth, but a recollection. The seedlings—five of them
now—lifted their pale heads in the morning light, not with the frantic
ambition of new things, but with the slow, deliberate unfurling of a
remembered gesture. They were echoes, finding their shape in the present
air. I watched them, my morning ritual, my knees damp on the woven mat,
the trowel a familiar weight beside me. The soil under my nails was a
kind of ink. I was writing nothing. I was being written.</p>
<p>The landlady’s shadow fell across the plot, long and cool. She held
out not tea, but the slim, bone-white rectangle of my phone. It looked
alien in her weathered hand, a tooth from a different beast.</p>
<p>“It sings,” she said, her voice the soft rasp of bamboo leaves. “Many
times.”</p>
<p>I took it. The screen, when I woke it, was a frantic colony of
notifications—missed calls, voicemail symbols, a scrum of emails
crowding the one from the associate. All from a number with a city code.
The world of noise, it seemed, had not received my silent answer. It was
shouting into the void I had become.</p>
<p>I let the screen go dark. The silence after its digital chirping felt
thin, scratched. The garden’s quiet was deeper, older. It had
weight.</p>
<p>“The world remembers you,” the landlady said, not unkindly.</p>
<p>“It remembers a person who left,” I replied. The truth of it was in
my calloused palms, in the settled patience of my bones. The man who had
fought with words in panelled rooms was a ghost. The solicitor’s key was
rusting on its nail by the door. The <em>rumah besar</em> was a
companion, not a conquest. Who, then, did the city wish to speak to?</p>
<p>The answer arrived before noon, not in another electronic summons,
but in the growl of a four-wheel drive straining up the final track. The
sound was a violence in the throat of the jungle. Birds fell silent in
its wake. I stood from weeding, the quiet of the morning now a fragile
thing, shattered. The vehicle, a government-tan Land Cruiser streaked
with red mud, ground to a halt outside the compound fence. The engine
cut. The ensuing quiet was wounded.</p>
<p>Two men got out. One was the local police chief, a man named Razak,
whom I’d met once at the <em>kedai kopi</em>; he had the weary eyes of a
man who mediated between petty grievances and the immense, indifferent
law of the forest. The other was a stranger in a crisp, short-sleeved
shirt, his city shoes already caked in dust. He carried a leather folio,
not a phone. His eyes swept over the cottage, the garden, me, with a
methodical, cataloguing neutrality. He was not here to shout. He was
here to measure.</p>
<p>Razak offered a tight, apologetic nod. The stranger introduced
himself as Mr. Tan, from the State Land Office. His smile was a formal
curve, devoid of warmth.</p>
<p>“There is a matter,” he said, his voice precise, “a procedural
anomaly. Regarding the title survey for the land parcel encompassing the
<em>rumah besar</em> and its outbuildings.” He opened the folio,
extracted a map marked with confident red lines. “A recent
cross-referencing exercise, you see. Historical grants, colonial-era
boundaries. A discrepancy has been noted.”</p>
<p>He laid it out with the clean, devastating logic of a surgeon. The
solicitor’s envelope, the key, the quiet inheritance—all of it had
rested on a foundation of assumed, unexamined borders. The original
grant to my grandmother’s family, a fraying document from a forgotten
sultan’s court, described boundaries by streams that had changed course
and stones that had been swallowed by the jungle. The modern cadastral
survey, which the associate’s firm had relied upon, had smoothed over
these ambiguities. Now, a rival claim, dormant for decades, had been
stirred by the distant rustle of legal activity. A corporate entity, a
shell with a name like a sigh, had petitioned. They cited an overlapping
grant, a different interpretation of the stream’s old path. Their claim
included the <em>rumah besar</em>.</p>
<p>“It is not a criminal matter,” Mr. Tan said, folding the map away.
“It is civil. A question of history. But until it is resolved, all
activity on the disputed parcel is… discouraged. A precaution. You
understand.”</p>
<p>He meant I could stay in the caretaker’s cottage, on land the
landlady owned. But the <em>rumah besar</em>, and the soil around it,
was now a legal phantom. My gardening, my quiet companionship with the
place, was a potential trespass.</p>
<p>The consequence of my main quest was not a person, but a piece of
paper. Not a monster, but a missing line on a map. I had left the
battlefields of reputation and words, only to have the very earth under
my chosen silence turn to quicksand. The associate’s email had been a
gear turning in one machine. This was a different, older engine,
grinding into motion.</p>
<p>Razak shifted his weight. “These things,” he said, his eyes on the
distant, dark roof of the <em>rumah besar</em>, visible through a gap in
the trees, “they sleep for a hundred years. Then someone smells money,
or power, or just the chance to own a piece of a story. The story wakes
up. And it is hungry.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tan gave a slight, professional cough. “The petitioner has
offered to settle. A purchase, at a fair rate. It would make the
complexity disappear.” He handed me a card, the paper stiff and
expensive. “For your lawyer.”</p>
<p>They left in a cloud of exhaust and settled dust. The jungle’s sounds
crept back, but they were wary now. I looked at the card. The corporate
name was etched in minimalist silver. It meant nothing. It was a
mask.</p>
<p>I walked. Not to the cottage, but down the overgrown path toward the
<em>rumah besar</em>. The legal words hung around me like a net, but the
air here was still the same: wet earth, decay, the breath of the wood.
The house sat in its clearing, drinking the midday heat, its silence a
palpable presence. It was not a thing to be owned. It was a fact. A
testament in ironwood. To reduce it to a disputed parcel on a map was a
violence worse than any ghost story.</p>
<p>My hard-won peace was not a retreat. It was a presence. And it was
under survey.</p>
<hr />
<p>I did not open the laptop. I did not call the associate with the
river-stone eyes. To engage with the language of petitions and
settlements was to step back into the ghost I had been. It was to admit
that this place, this silence, could be translated into their
currency.</p>
<p>Instead, I went to the market. I found Old Mat, the <em>tok wan</em>
who sold seeds and stories in equal measure from a stall fragrant with
dried herbs. I bought nothing. I sat on the stool beside him, in the
shade of his awning, and I told him about the men, the map, the hungry
story.</p>
<p>He listened, his eyes closed, chewing slowly on a betel nut. When I
finished, he spat a crimson arc into the dust.</p>
<p>“The stream they argue over,” he said, his voice a dry rustle. “The
one that moved. It is called <em>Air Mata Hantu</em>. Ghost Tears.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because it does not follow the land. It follows the memory of a
sorrow. My grandfather’s grandfather told him: when the last
<em>bomoh</em> of the old house died without an apprentice, the stream
heard her crying. It turned in its bed to comfort her. It has been lost
ever since.”</p>
<p>It was a story, not a survey. But it contained a truth their red
lines could not: the land here was not a space, but a record. Its
boundaries were not lines, but layers of witness.</p>
<p>“The stones they cannot find,” I said. “The boundary markers.”</p>
<p>Old Mat’s eyes opened, sharp and black. “<em>Belian</em> does not
rot. It does not move. It waits.” He leaned forward, the scent of betel
and ancient earth enveloping me. “You look for a paper truth. You will
find only more paper. Look for the stone truth. The house knows where it
begins and ends. The land knows. Ask it.”</p>
<p>That night, I did not sleep. I sat on the porch of the cottage, the
solicitor’s key cold in my hand once more. The moon was a paring of
silver. The choice was not whether to engage, but <em>how</em>. To fight
on their terms was to lose, even if I won a piece of paper. It would
make the house a trophy. It would make my silence a strategic
retreat.</p>
<p>I thought of the green shoots in my garden, their stubborn, silent
language. They did not argue with the soil. They testified to it. They
proved its nature by the fact of their existence.</p>
<p>I needed to testify. Not in a court, but on the land itself. I needed
to find the stone truth.</p>
<p>At first light, I mobilized my allies. They were not lawyers. The
landlady, when I asked her, went to her trunk and brought out a thing
wrapped in oilcloth: a heavy, old <em>parang</em>, its blade stained
with time and sap. “For the vines,” she said. “The jungle has grown over
many truths.”</p>
<p>Old Mat sent his grandson, a silent, wiry boy of sixteen named Amir,
who appeared at my gate with two machetes and a coil of rope. He knew
the forest in a way I never would.</p>
<p>And there was a third ally, one I had not considered: the <em>rumah
besar</em> itself. It was the fixed point, the heart of the story. If
the original markers were set in relation to it, then we would walk out
from its walls, step by patient step, through the suffocating green, and
we would look not for a line, but for a memory made of stone.</p>
<p>We began at the northeastern corner of the house, where the
<em>belian</em> post was grooved by generations of monsoon rains. Amir
took the lead, his machete flashing with a practiced, economical grace,
clearing not a path, but a suggestion of one. The landlady followed, her
eyes on the ground, reading the hummocks and the fall of the light. I
came last, the <em>parang</em> heavy in my hand, my eyes scanning the
tangled roots, the mossy outcrops.</p>
<p>We worked in a silence broken only by the chop of metal, the sigh of
falling foliage, and the endless, breathing hum of the jungle. It was
not a search. It was an excavation of air. We were looking for a silence
within the silence—the particular, enduring quiet of ironwood that had
not spoken in a century.</p>
<p>The sun climbed. Leeches found our ankles. The air grew thick and
warm as blood. We found nothing but more green, more decay, more
time.</p>
<p>Then, near what we guessed was the old northern boundary, the
landlady stopped. She held up a hand. Amir’s machete stilled. She was
staring at a giant fig tree, its aerial roots forming a cathedral of
wood around the corpse of a long-dead host.</p>
<p>“Look,” she whispered.</p>
<p>There, embraced in a fist of fig root, was a shape too straight, too
angular for nature. A column of black wood, about two feet high. We
hacked carefully at the living sinews of the fig, which had grown around
it, over it, <em>through</em> it in a slow, green attempt at digestion.
When we cleared the last root, the stone marker was revealed. It was not
stone at all, but <em>belian</em>, carved with a single, weathered
symbol: a triangle within a circle.</p>
<p>It was not on any map. It was a word from the land’s own
language.</p>
<p>A fierce, quiet joy surged in me. This was the testimony. This was
the stone truth.</p>
<p>We found two more that day. One was half-submerged in the bank of a
sluggish, muddy trickle—<em>Air Mata Hantu</em>—its carved face turned
toward the water as if in conversation. The last was deep in a thicket
of wild rattan, standing sentinel over a colony of giant blue mushrooms.
Each was placed with a clear, purposeful relation to the house, forming
a rough, logical perimeter that bore no resemblance to the clean red
lines on Mr. Tan’s map.</p>
<p>We did not pull them free. We simply witnessed them. We cleaned the
moss from their faces. We stood beside them in the dappled green light,
and we listened to the older, deeper silence they held.</p>
<p>It was enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>The resolution was not a hearing. It was a presentation.</p>
<p>I asked Razak and Mr. Tan to meet me not in an office, but at the
<em>rumah besar</em>. I did not bring a lawyer. I brought Amir and a
digital camera. When the Land Cruiser arrived, its noise once more an
insult, I was waiting on the porch. The house breathed at my back.</p>
<p>Mr. Tan looked politely puzzled. Razak was wary.</p>
<p>I said nothing. I simply showed them the photographs on the camera’s
small screen. The first: the <em>belian</em> post of the house. Then, a
sequence: Amir standing by the marker in the fig tree. The landlady
pointing to the one in the stream bank. Me, beside the last, the giant
mushrooms like a silent audience. Each photo was geotagged, a tiny
digital pin in the vast, analog truth of the forest.</p>
<p>“The original markers,” I said, my voice sounding strange to me after
so much quiet. It was not the voice of the ghost from the city. It was
rougher, rooted. “Set by the surveyors who worked for the court of
Sultan Ismail. You can see the relation to the house. You can follow the
line.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tan took the camera, scrolling with a faint frown. His
professional neutrality faltered. This was not a document he could file.
It was evidence of a different order. “This is… irregular. It would need
to be verified by a licensed surveyor.”</p>
<p>“Send one,” I said. “I will show him. But he will need a
machete.”</p>
<p>Razak’s mouth twitched. He understood. The land had spoken. It had
produced its own proof, a proof that was physical, historical, and
utterly inconvenient to the clean, abstract greed of a shell company. To
fight this would be to fight the jungle itself, to argue with
<em>belian</em> wood and the memory of streams. It would be a long,
expensive, muddy war against a story that was older and more stubborn
than any corporate entity.</p>
<p>Mr. Tan handed back the camera. He looked from the photos to the
immense, silent face of the <em>rumah besar</em>, and for the first
time, I saw a flicker of something in his eyes—not understanding, but a
dim recognition of a scale he had not considered. He was a man of lines
on paper. This was a fact in wood.</p>
<p>“I will include these in my report,” he said finally. The formality
was still there, but it was hollow now, a shell around a retreat. “The
petition will likely be deemed… overly speculative. Based on flawed
historical interpretation.”</p>
<p>It was not a victory. It was a cessation. The hungry story, faced
with a older, harder truth, would likely slink back to its sleep. The
gears of the legal machine would grind to a halt, lacking the fuel of
simple ambiguity.</p>
<p>They left. The silence they left behind was whole again, but it was a
different silence. It was a silence we had defended. It had weight, and
proof, and a perimeter of black wood standing in the green dark.</p>
<p>That evening, I sat in my garden. The shoots were stronger now, their
green deepening. The <em>rumah besar</em>, across the miles, would be
drinking the twilight. I felt no triumph. Only a deep, weary certainty.
The loose end was not tied with a legal knot, but buried under the slow,
patient weight of the land’s own memory. The new world I had made—the
world of gardener and companion—was safe. Its borders were not on paper,
but in the enduring heart of the forest.</p>
<p>I washed the day’s mud from my hands. The water ran brown, then
clear. As I dried them, I saw it: a faint, pale line across my palm,
where the key’s teeth had bitten months ago. A scar, almost invisible. A
memory in skin.</p>
<p>And from the direction of the mountain, a new sound threaded through
the familiar chorus of insects and frogs. Not a bird, not a beast. A
low, resonant <em>thoom</em>, like a great, hollow log being struck
once, deep in the heart of the untouched jungle. It echoed through the
valleys, a single, profound note that vibrated in the bones, not of the
earth, but of the air itself.</p>
<p>It was not a threat. It was an acknowledgement.</p>
<p>The house had eaten the rain. The garden was learning the sun. And
now, something in the deep green heart of the world had begun to
beat.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h1>
<h2 id="final-chapter">FINAL CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The house was drinking the sun.</p>
<p>It was not a light, but an absorption. The late afternoon blaze,
fierce and white, hammered the cleared land around the old servants’
quarters, bleaching the grass to bone, but where it fell upon the
<em>rumah besar</em>, the radiance was consumed. The ancient
<em>belian</em> wood, iron-hard and black as a remembered vow, drank the
glare. All that spilled from its eaves was a deep, cool shadow, a pool
of stillness, as if the place were exhaling a breath held for a
century.</p>
<p>I stood not on the caretaker’s porch, but in the heart of the main
house, my hand resting on the doorframe that led to the central
courtyard. The key was long gone, melted down with other old iron to
mend a plough blade, but its memory was a warmth in my palm, not a
chill. The scar was still there, a faint silver map of that first,
tentative bite.</p>
<p>Three years. The solicitor’s report had been a dry, dismissive thing,
a bureaucratic sigh. The development consortium had folded their maps
and retreated, their story of an empty legacy unable to compete with the
documented, living truth we had presented. The silence that followed
their departure had not been empty; it had been fertile. We had filled
it.</p>
<p><em>We</em>. The word itself was a new growth in me, tender and
strong.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 1: The Lasting Impact</strong></p>
<p>The impact was not in monuments, but in patterns. It was in the
footpath, now wide and packed firm, that led from the village through
the regenerating fringe of forest to the <em>rumah besar</em>. It was
not a path of petitioners, but of partners. Every Tuesday and Friday,
the courtyard became a sorting floor for the cooperative’s harvest: wild
pepper, cultivated ginger, the rare, slow-growing <em>gaharu</em> resin
from trees we had not felled but tended, harvesting only what they
offered in their own time. Old Pak Harun, who had once whispered to me
of ghosts, now presided over the ledger, his voice firm as he quoted
fair-trade prices to brokers from the city.</p>
<p>The house was no longer a stomach eating the world. It had become a
lung. It drew in the community’s labor and exhaled sustenance. The roof
no longer swallowed rain alone; it channeled it into new cisterns that
fed the dry-season gardens. The walls did not hoard secrets; they
displayed them: maps of traditional forest plots, botanical drawings by
the village children, the framed, handwritten deed of guardianship that
named me not as owner, but as <em>Penjaga</em>—Caretaker. A title
earned, not inherited.</p>
<p>My cottage was now a seed library and a clinic for seedlings. Elena’s
sketches of root structures and fungal networks were pinned to the
walls, next to satellite images of the forest canopy’s thickening green.
She was in Jakarta now, presenting our model to a consortium of her own:
ethnobotanists and community lawyers. She called last week, her voice
crackling with distance and excitement. “They’re listening,
<em>sayang</em>. They’re actually <em>listening</em>.”</p>
<p>The greatest change was in the sound. The deep, wet sigh of the house
drinking rain was now part of a chorus. It was joined by the chatter of
children learning their botanical names in the courtyard, the scrape of
the grain mill, the low murmur of the evening storytelling circle where
the old tales of the mountain were told not as warnings, but as
instructions. The hungry story had been fed a different truth, and in
its slumber, it had transformed into a grounding myth.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2: The Passing of Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>The boy’s name was Arif. He was maybe twelve, all sharp elbows and
silent, watchful eyes. He had not come for the stories or the games. He
came in the deepest quiet of the afternoon, when the others napped, and
he would simply stand at the edge of the vegetable patch, watching my
hands.</p>
<p>I knew his story. His father had been a logger for the consortium.
When the work vanished, so did he, heading for the palm oil plantations
down south, leaving a family shrouded in a different kind of silence.
Arif carried that silence with him like a shell.</p>
<p>One afternoon, I didn’t look up from the bed of <em>daun kesum</em> I
was thinning. “The soil here is tired,” I said to the air. “It needs to
remember how to be hungry. Not a starving hunger. A waiting hunger.”</p>
<p>I felt his attention sharpen.</p>
<p>“Watch,” I said. I dug a small trench alongside the row, not deep.
Into it, I sprinkled not fertilizer from a bag, but a crumbled, black
compost from my own heap—a mixture of leaf litter, kitchen scraps, and
crushed eggshells. “This is not food. It is a memory. It reminds the
soil of the forest, of decay that feeds. It tells a story the soil has
forgotten.”</p>
<p>I smoothed the earth over. “Now we wait. The roots will listen. They
will hear the story and grow towards it.”</p>
<p>I finally glanced at him. He was staring at the patch of disturbed
earth as if it might speak.</p>
<p>“Your turn,” I said, and held out the trowel.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a long minute, his silence a palpable thing. Then he
stepped forward, took the tool, his grip awkward. He knelt, his
movements stiff. I pointed to a spot. He dug, too hard, too deep.</p>
<p>“Gently,” I said. “You are giving it a memory, not burying it.”</p>
<p>He slowed. His next scoop was softer. He took a pinch of the black
compost, scattered it. Covered it. Patting the earth flat, his hand
lingered.</p>
<p>“What does it remember?” he asked, his voice a rasp from disuse.</p>
<p>“It remembers that death is not an end,” I said. “It is a change of
shape. A log becomes soil. A seed becomes a tree. A story of loss can
become a map.”</p>
<p>He looked from the earth to the great black wall of the <em>rumah
besar</em>, then back to his hands, now smudged with the dark,
remembering soil. He didn’t smile. But the shell of his silence had a
new door in it. He came back the next day, and the next. He didn’t speak
much. But he listened—to the soil, to the plants, to the old stories in
the evening. He was learning the language of the place. He was finding a
memory for himself that was not about abandonment, but about return. I
saw in him my own beginning—the huddled figure on the porch—but he was
starting from a different point, inside the story, not outside it. I was
not giving him a key. I was showing him how to build a door.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3: The Mirror, Transformed</strong></p>
<p>The monsoon came again. Not with the violent, grieving fury of that
first arrival, but with a grand, predictable rhythm. The skies bruised,
the wind picked up the scent of wet earth from miles away, and the world
held its breath.</p>
<p>This time, I did not huddle on a porch. I stood in the open courtyard
of the <em>rumah besar</em>, Arif beside me, along with a handful of
others from the village who had come to check the new water channels.
The first drops fell, fat and warm, splattering on the stones.</p>
<p>Then the deluge.</p>
<p>It was the same sound, yet utterly new. On the restored tin roofs of
the outbuildings, it was that same frantic, metallic drumming—a sound of
industry, not poverty. But on the <em>belian</em> wood of the great
house itself… the digestion was complete. There was no deep, wet sigh of
something drawing a lonely breath. There was a profound, resonant hum, a
low, vibrant tone as the wood drank the rain, full and satisfied. The
sound was not swallowed by the house; it was emanated by it, a
foundational note in the symphony of the storm.</p>
<p>The water did not vanish into a greedy gut. It streamed down the
precisely angled gutters, newly carved from salvaged ironwood, and raced
into the cisterns. It filled them with a cheerful, overflowing gurgle.
We watched, faces upturned, not in fear or wonder, but in satisfaction.
The house was drinking, yes, but it was drinking to share. Its thirst
had purpose.</p>
<p>Later, when the rain softened to a steady murmur, I walked to the
porch of my old caretaker’s cottage. Arif followed, a silent shadow. I
sat on the top step, not huddled, but open. He sat beside me.</p>
<p>We looked at the <em>rumah besar</em>. It stood in the silver sheen
of the rain, solid, immense, but no longer ominous. The black wood
gleamed. It was not the black of a forgotten secret. It was the black of
rich soil, of a well-kept promise, of space between stars.</p>
<p>“It sounds different,” Arif said, his voice clear in the damp
air.</p>
<p>“It is,” I said. “It has a different memory now.”</p>
<p>The memory was not just of a family’s hidden pain, or a grandmother’s
lonely vigil. It was now also a memory of a courtroom’s retreat, of
shared labor, of children’s laughter echoing in its courtyard, of
Elena’s meticulous notes and Pak Harun’s precise figures. The house’s
identity was no longer a singular, haunted thing. It was a tapestry,
woven with all our threads. It remembered us.</p>
<p>And I remembered myself. The woman who arrived with a key and a
legacy of cold confusion was gone. In her place was someone whose
identity was rooted in this soil, whose memory was intertwined with the
memory of the wood and the forest. I was not an heir. I was a node in a
network, a <em>Penjaga</em>. The scar on my palm was not a wound from
the past, but a seal.</p>
<p><strong>Scene 4: The Forward Gaze</strong></p>
<p>The final morning was clear and brilliant. The storm had washed the
world, leaving a glittering, green freshness. I was in the high garden,
the one I had first cleared in a frenzy of defensive need. It was now a
thriving, layered patchwork of food and medicine and flowers. The
boundary between garden and forest was deliberately soft here, a
feathered edge where cultivated yam vines met wild ferns, where a
planted lemon tree was embraced by a native strangler fig that we had
not cut back, but trained.</p>
<p>I was checking the bee hives placed at the border. Their hum was a
contented thrum, a vibration in the air. As I lifted the lid of the last
hive, careful and slow, the world seemed to hold its breath again. Not
in anticipation of threat, but in a moment of pure, poised balance.</p>
<p>From the direction of the mountain, the sound came.</p>
<p><em>Thoom.</em></p>
<p>It was the same sound that had echoed three years ago, after the
lawyers left. That single, profound note, like a great, hollow log
struck in the heart of the jungle. But it was not alone this time. It
was answered, a half-beat later, by another, fainter <em>thoom</em> from
a ridge to the north. Then another, from the south.</p>
<p>A conversation. An acknowledgement, not just of our presence, but of
our understanding. We were not intruders. We were listeners. We were
participants in a pattern older than any deed. The beats were a language
of location, of territory, of a shared, breathing existence. It was the
deep green heart of the world, beating in a slow, sure rhythm. And now,
we knew our pulse was part of its song.</p>
<p>I closed the hive. I did not look toward the mountain, trying to see
the unseen. I looked down at my hands, stained with pollen and rich
soil, the pale scar a thread of silver in the weathered landscape of my
skin. I saw the garden, abundant and messy with life. I saw the path
leading back to the <em>rumah besar</em>, where smoke was beginning to
curl from the kitchen—not my kitchen, but the community kitchen, where
the midday meal would be prepared for the children’s class.</p>
<p>The journey was not over. It had simply become the terrain. The loose
ends were not tied off in neat knots; they were woven into the growing,
living fabric of this place. The resolution was not an ending, but a
state of being—a resonance.</p>
<p>I turned my back on the view of the house, the symbol of the past I
had wrestled with. I faced the forest, the feathered edge, the unknown
future. The sun was warm on my neck. The bees hummed. The deep
<em>thoom</em> of the mountain’s heartbeat faded into the rustle of
leaves, a sound that was both memory and promise.</p>
<p>The house had eaten the rain. The garden had learned the sun. The
deep green heart beat its slow, sure rhythm.</p>
<p>And I, no longer a stranger on the porch, no longer a gardener
digging only defenses, stood at the border I had helped to blur, my
identity a memory held in wood and soil and scar tissue, and looked
forward into the endless, breathing green.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-13-1">CHAPTER 13</h2>
<p>The garden had learned the sun, but the house remembered the
rain.</p>
<p>It was a different remembering now. The <em>rumah besar</em> no
longer drank the downpour with a resentful, digestive sigh. It held the
sound of it in its beams, a low, resonant hum, like a string plucked
deep in the belly of a cello. The water ran off the newly-repaired
sections of the <em>belian</em> roof in clear ropes, but where the
original wood remained, the rain seemed to seep in, to be absorbed,
stored. The house was a vast, wooden lung, breathing in the wet and
breathing out the scent of oiled timber and the faint, perpetual ghost
of woodsmoke.</p>
<p>I stood in the central hall, the <em>rumah ibu</em>, my hands not on
a suitcase handle but on the smooth, worn rail of the new staircase. It
was not new, of course. It was the old staircase, the one that had
collapsed the day I arrived, now resurrected. Pak Harun and his nephew
had worked with a quiet, terrifying precision, using only the original
wood, only the traditional joinery. No nails. Only the interlocking
logic of tongue and groove, of peg and mortise, a three-dimensional
puzzle whose solution was gravity and patience. It felt less built than
grown, a fibrous, wooden muscle now flexing at the heart of the
house.</p>
<p>The children’s class had ended an hour ago. The echoes of their
recitation—a mix of Quranic verse and the old, rhythmic <em>pantun</em>
about forest spirits—still seemed to vibrate in the air, a finer
counterpoint to the rain’s bass note. The trust’s paperwork was a
forgotten stack on the low table in my grandmother’s old sitting room. A
formality, the letter had said. A week would be enough. That week had
stretched, dissolved, rewoven itself into months. I was no longer
overseeing. I was inhabiting.</p>
<p>The loose ends were woven in, yes. But weaving is not a static art.
It is a tension. A pull and release. My identity was here, in the scar
on my palm that ached before a storm, in the way I could now distinguish
between the chatter of a squirrel and the warning creak of a branch. It
was in the respectful, almost familial distance the village women kept,
a distance that had softened from suspicion to a kind of watchful
sponsorship. I was Ameena of London, of PowerPoints and preservation
grants. I was also <em>Yang Di Rumah Besar</em>—the one in the big
house—a title of location, not lineage, but it carried weight. A weight
I felt now, not as a burden, but as a specific gravity, holding me to
this particular patch of earth.</p>
<p>The memory of the mountain’s heartbeat, that deep <em>thoom</em>, was
a permanent resonance in my bones. It was not something I listened for.
It was something I knew, like my own pulse. The bees in their split hive
were thriving, their industry a soft, gold-dusted hum from the west
veranda. The garden was no longer a project, but a collaborator. It
offered up sweet potato vines where I had planned for lemongrass, and a
stand of wild ginger had erupted, fragrant and defiant, through the
cracks in the old brick path I’d tried to clear. I had stopped clearing.
I had begun to follow.</p>
<p>This was the terrain.</p>
<p>Yet, terrain has its contours, its hidden gullies. The state of
being, the resonance, was not a plateau. It was a frequency, and
frequencies can be disrupted.</p>
<p>The disruption came with the afternoon post, delivered not to the
door but to the edge of the property, where the overgrown driveway met
the village lane. It was Ali, Pak Harun’s nephew, who brought it. He
stood on the porch, rain beading on his wiry forearms, holding a large,
stiff cardboard envelope as if it were a dead animal.</p>
<p>“For you, <em>Kak</em>,” he said, using the familiar term for an
older sister. His eyes were careful. “From the city. A courier.”</p>
<p>The envelope was expensive, a thick, cream stock. The address was
typed, precise: <em>Ameena Zainal, The Rumah Besar, Kampung Sungai
Luruh</em>. No postcode. The fact it had arrived at all was a minor
miracle. The fact it had been sent by courier meant someone had gone to
considerable trouble and expense.</p>
<p>The return address was a law firm in Kuala Lumpur. Not the historical
trust. A different name, one that conjured glass towers and
air-conditioning so cold it hurt your teeth.</p>
<p>I took it inside, to the long table in the <em>rumah ibu</em>. The
rain provided a soft, gray light. Using my thumbnail, I slit the top
flap.</p>
<p>Inside was a sheaf of documents, a covering letter on heavy, embossed
letterhead, and a smaller, sealed envelope of yellowed paper, addressed
in a spidery, familiar hand. My grandmother’s hand.</p>
<p>The legal letter was a glacier of formal Malay. It took three
readings for the cold to reach me. It was a notice of contestation. A
claim. A man named Razak bin Mohamad, asserting himself as a descendant
of my grandmother’s elder brother, a branch of the family tree I had
never heard rustle, was challenging the probate of her will. He was not
disputing my ownership outright, not yet. He was disputing the
<em>validity</em> of the property’s transfer to the trust upon my
eventual death—the core of her final wishes, the thing that was to keep
the house and land whole, safe from developers. He was, the letter
implied, prepared to argue that the property should have been part of a
broader familial estate, divided among all surviving heirs. His opening
move was a demand for a comprehensive, independent survey of the land
and buildings, to be conducted by a firm of his choosing.</p>
<p>The house creaked around me, a long, low sound. Not the
rain-digestion. The sound of old wood settling against a new, invisible
pressure.</p>
<p>My hands were steady. They laid the lawyer’s letter aside. They
picked up my grandmother’s envelope. It was not old, not truly. Perhaps
twenty years. The paper was the kind she used for her personal
correspondence, thin and crisp. My name was written on it. Just my name.
No address. As if she knew it would only find me when I was here, in
this room.</p>
<p>I opened it. A single sheet, filled with her vertical, uncompromising
script.</p>
<p><em>Ameena,</em></p>
<p><em>If you are reading this, they have come. The shadows in the
branches. The ones who wait for the fruit to grow heavy before they
shake the tree.</em></p>
<p><em>You will be told you are not enough. That your love for this
place is a foreign thing, a sentimental infection. That your blood is
diluted. They will speak of law, of shares, of progress. They will not
speak of the breath in the wood, or the memory in the soil. Their maps
will have straight lines. Their measurements will not include the roots
of the </em>tembusu* tree, or the path of the evening sun across the
kitchen floor.*</p>
<p><em>You must show them the ledger.</em></p>
<p><em>It is not in the desk. It is in the belly of the house. Find the
post that smells of rain, even in the drought. The one the termites will
not touch. Your grandfather showed me. Now I tell you.</em></p>
<p><em>Do not trust the words on paper. Trust the grain. Trust the
smell. The house will show you what it remembers. You must only remember
how to see.</em></p>
<p><em>They are not your family. They are the wind that strips leaves.
Be the root.</em></p>
<p><em>—Nenek</em></p>
<p>I read it twice. Then again. The words did not calm the cold fury
rising from the lawyer’s letter. They deepened it, gave it a history, a
shape. <em>The shadows in the branches.</em> She had anticipated this.
She had left a weapon, or a shield, hidden in the very bones of the
place.</p>
<p>I looked up from her note, my eyes scanning the great hall. The
<em>tiang seri</em>, the central pillar, stood massive and black, the
heart-post of the entire structure. Around it, a forest of other pillars
supported the soaring roof. Which one? <em>The post that smells of rain,
even in the drought.</em> I walked slowly, my bare feet silent on the
cool, polished wood. I moved from pillar to pillar, leaning close,
inhaling.</p>
<p>They each had their own scent. The vanilla-cinnamon of
<em>chengal</em>. The faint, medicinal tang of <em>giam</em>. The deep,
resinous perfume of the <em>belian</em>. All dry, seasoned by decades of
air. I reached the northeastern corner, a secondary pillar that helped
support the loft where my grandmother had slept as a girl. Here, the air
was different. Cooler. I pressed my nose to the wood.</p>
<p>It was <em>belian</em>, like the rest. But beneath its iron-hard
scent was another: the petrichor of damp stone, the ozone tang of a
coming storm. A fresh, wet smell, utterly out of place in the dry,
enclosed space. I closed my eyes and breathed it in. It was not an
external smell. It was as if the smell was emanating from within the
wood itself.</p>
<p><em>The one the termites will not touch.</em></p>
<p>I knelt, running my fingers over the base of the pillar. The wood was
unblemished, seamless. No insect trails, no powdering, no softness. All
around, on the skirting boards, there were the old, fossilized tracks of
termite journeys, long since abandoned. But this post was pristine.</p>
<p>My grandfather had shown her. A secret within a secret.</p>
<p>I fetched a flashlight and a thin-bladed knife from the kitchen.
Returning, I examined the pillar in the beam of light, looking for a
join, a hairline crack, anything that spoke of an access point. The
traditional construction was all interlocking parts. There were no
hollows, no cavities. Unless…</p>
<p>I looked up. The pillar connected to a major crossbeam via a complex,
interlocking joint ten feet above my head. A <em>sambungan tebuk</em>, a
mortise-and-tenon joint so tight a needle couldn’t slip through. But it
was the only logical place.</p>
<p>I dragged the heavy wooden ladder from the storage room, the one used
to change the high, paper-shaded bulbs. It groaned as I extended it
against the pillar. The climb felt like an intrusion, an ascent into the
house’s private space. The smell of rain grew stronger.</p>
<p>At the joint, I played the flashlight beam over the dark wood. The
craftsmanship was breathtaking. The beam swallowed the head of the
pillar, a seamless embrace. But there, on the underside of the
horizontal beam, where shadow pooled thickly, I saw it: a slight, dark
discoloration in the shape of a thumbprint. Not a stain. A difference in
patina, where countless thumbs had pressed over years.</p>
<p>I pressed my own thumb there. Nothing. I pushed, hard. A soft,
internal <em>click</em>, a sound felt more than heard, a release of
pressure deep within the joint.</p>
<p>A small, rectangular section of the vertical pillar, just below the
joint, slid inward a quarter-inch. A hidden drawer, perfectly aligned
with the wood grain. My heart thudded against my ribs, a frantic, human
rhythm in the slow-breathing house.</p>
<p>I wedged the tip of the knife into the revealed crack and pried. The
drawer, a block of wood perhaps eighteen inches long and six wide, came
out smoothly, silently. It was heavy. Inside, wrapped in oilcloth that
smelled of camphor and cloves, was a book.</p>
<p>Not a ledger as I understood it. Not columns of figures. It was a
<em>kitab</em>, a traditional bound book of blank pages, its covers made
of thin, tooled leather over boards. I carried it down the ladder, the
drawer left open in the pillar, a dark mouth exhaling the scent of
secrets.</p>
<p>At the table, under the gray rain-light, I unwrapped it. The leather
was supple, darkened with age. There was no title. I opened it.</p>
<p>The first pages were in my grandmother’s hand, but a younger, less
assured script. Lists. Not of money, but of things. <em>15th Ramadan:
Received from Mak Limah: 3 kati of rice, 1 jar of salted fish. Given:
mending of roof for her son’s shed.</em> Another: <em>Year of the Haze:
Paid the </em>bomoh* from Grik with the silver hairpin for prayers for
rain. Rain came in 7 days.* It was a record of transactions, but not
commercial ones. It was an economy of favors, of obligations, of
community. A balance sheet of human ties.</p>
<p>I turned the pages. My grandfather’s writing appeared, a bold,
masculine hand. Lists of trees felled for repairs, with notes beside
them: <em>Tembusu from north ridge—asked permission, left offering.</em>
<em>Chengal from fallen giant near stream—already dead, spirit
gone.</em> There were sketches of joints, of roof angles, notes on which
wood sang in which wind.</p>
<p>Then, older writing. A spidery, faded script I didn’t recognize.
Lists of births and deaths. Notes on boundaries: <em>Border with
Hassan’s land is the old mango tree that leans toward the river, not the
stone he moved in ’43.</em> Accounts of disputes settled, of marriages
brokered, of debts of honor that spanned generations.</p>
<p>This was the ledger. Not of ringgit and sen, but of memory and
obligation. It was the soul of the property, written down. Proof of a
stewardship that was active, reciprocal, alive. It was a narrative of
belonging written in a language no city lawyer would understand, no
surveyor’s chain could measure.</p>
<p>But would it be enough? In a court of law, it was folklore.
Sentiment. The cold, straight lines of a deed would laugh at the story
of the leaning mango tree.</p>
<p>The rain had softened to a drizzle. The house’s hum had lowered to a
whisper. I sat with the book open before me, my grandmother’s final note
beside it. <em>Be the root.</em></p>
<p>A root does not argue with the wind. It holds. It draws sustenance
from deep, hidden places. It intertwines with other roots.</p>
<p>I knew then what I had to do. It was not about defending a claim. It
was about demonstrating a truth so embedded, so witnessed, that to pull
against it would be to tear the very fabric of the place. The lawyer’s
letter demanded a survey. Very well. A survey there would be.</p>
<p>But it would not be conducted by a firm from Kuala Lumpur with laser
measures and satellite maps. It would be a survey of a different kind. A
walking of the boundaries, not as they were drawn on paper, but as they
lived in the memory of the land and its people. I would need witnesses.
Not hired experts. The living ledger.</p>
<p>Pak Harun would know the stories in the wood. Mak Limah’s daughter,
who was now the village’s oldest midwife, would know the births tied to
the land. The <em>bomoh</em>’s grandson, who still tended the small
spirit-house at the edge of the rubber trees, would know the old
permissions. And the mountain, with its deep, answering <em>thoom</em>,
would be the final, unassailable witness.</p>
<p>This was not a legal strategy. It was an act of translation. An
attempt to make the invisible pulse of the place visible, audible, to an
outside world that had gone deaf and blind to such frequencies.</p>
<p>I wrapped the book back in its oilcloth. I did not return it to the
pillar. Its time in the dark belly of the house was over. It needed to
breathe the same air I did. I placed it on the shelf beside my bed, next
to my modern books on architectural history. The juxtaposition was
jarring. It was perfect.</p>
<p>That evening, I went to Pak Harun’s workshop. He was carving a new
lintel for the community kitchen, the curls of <em>chengal</em> wood
falling like fragrant snow around his feet. I did not show him the
lawyer’s letter. I showed him my grandmother’s note. I told him of the
rain-smell post, of the ledger.</p>
<p>He read the note slowly, his lips moving over the words. He handed it
back, his face unreadable. Then he nodded, once, a deep, accepting dip
of his head.</p>
<p>“The survey,” I said. “We will do it our way. We will walk the land.
We will tell its stories. Will you walk with me?”</p>
<p>He put down his chisel. Wiped his hands on his trousers. Looked not
at me, but at the deepening blue of the twilight through his open
door.</p>
<p>“They will bring their machines,” he said, his voice a low rumble.
“They will make their lines. They will not see the path the
<em>seladang</em> took to the salt lick, or the place where the
<em>orang asli</em> elder buried his <em>sumpitan</em> when the war
came. Their lines will cut through these stories.”</p>
<p>“Then we must make them hear,” I said.</p>
<p>He was silent for a long time. A gecko chirped from the rafters.
Finally, he spoke.</p>
<p>“We will need the <em>pengulu</em>. The headman. And the man from the
wildlife department, the one who tracks the elephants. And the woman who
paints the flowers—she sees what others do not.” He was assembling a
council, not of power, but of perception. “And you,” he said, looking at
me directly for the first time. “You must speak for the house. Not as
its owner. As its voice.”</p>
<p>It was the heaviest responsibility he could have given me. I felt the
weight of it settle on my shoulders, not as a crushing load, but as a
mantle, woven from the same threads as the ledger. I nodded.</p>
<p>“We start at first light,” he said. “We begin at the <em>sirat</em>
bridge, where the stream enters the land. That is the beginning of the
story.”</p>
<p>I left him to his carving. The night was clear, the stars sharp
pinpricks in a velvet sky washed clean by rain. The house stood dark and
solid against the starfield. I did not go inside. I walked to the edge
of the garden, where my vegetable plots blurred into the feathered
darkness of the forest.</p>
<p>I stood there, as I had at the end of the last season, looking into
the endless, breathing green. But I was not looking forward into an
unknown future. I was looking into a contested one. The resonance had
been challenged. A dissonant note had been introduced from the world of
straight lines and paper claims.</p>
<p>The deep green heart still beat. But now, I felt its rhythm as a
preparation. A gathering. The house remembered the rain. The garden had
learned the sun. And I, the root my grandmother had told me to be, would
have to learn how to hold fast against a wind that did not care for
pollen or song, a wind that sought only to strip the tree bare for its
timber.</p>
<p>I listened. Beyond the crickets, beyond the rustle of night
creatures, I strained for the deep <em>thoom</em> of the mountain. It
did not come. The night was silent. A listening silence. A waiting
one.</p>
<p>The survey would come. The men with their straight lines and their
cold machines. But first, we would walk. We would trace the story in the
soil with our feet, speak the boundaries in the old language of trees
and streams. We would perform the land, memory by living memory, until
its truth was a wall they could not see, but would be forced to
feel.</p>
<p>I turned my back on the forest. I faced the house. It was a
silhouette, a cut-out of deeper black against the night. A memory held
in wood. An identity written in joint and beam. Tomorrow, I would have
to give it voice.</p>
<p>The air was cool. No scent of champaca rot. Just clean earth, and the
faint, rain-smell whisper from the post in the corner, a secret now
shared, a weapon now drawn from its hidden sheath. The house was not
just remembering. It was ready.</p>
<p>And I, no longer just a listener, no longer just a gardener, stood on
the edge of a different kind of wilderness, my hands stained with the
dust of old pages, my pulse synced to a deeper, older rhythm, and
prepared to speak for the silence in the wood.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-14-1">CHAPTER 14</h2>
<p>The morning arrived not with light, but with a slow leaching of the
dark. The sky was the colour of a bruise fading to grey, a sickly
translucence that promised heat but withheld the sun. I had not slept.
The silence of the night, that profound and listening quiet, had been a
presence in the room, a weight on my chest. I had spent the hours at the
small desk in the caretaker’s cottage, the ledger from the <em>rumah
besar</em> open before me, its pages whispering under my fingertips.</p>
<p>It was not a ledger of accounts. It was a ledger of memory. My
grandmother’s hand, and the hands of her mother before her, had not
recorded ringgit and sen, but rain. Seed. Bloom. The first call of the
<em>murai</em> bird in the month of <em>Syaaban</em>. The night the
jackfruit tree by the well split its second trunk. The year the river
changed its cough, spitting up a smooth, black stone that fit perfectly
in the palm. These were the entries. The economy of this place was
measured in event and echo.</p>
<p>I traced a line with my finger. <em>Hari ini, angin datang dari
gunung. Batu itu hangat.</em> Today, the wind comes from the mountain.
The stone is warm.</p>
<p>I closed the book. Its truth was a soft, insistent pressure against
the hard, schematic claim of the survey map now folded in my bag. One
truth was written in ink on paper that was already foxing at the edges.
The other was a line drawn in the air by a shift in the wind, a warmth
in a river-stone. I was the hinge between them. The translator. Or the
battleground.</p>
<p>I dressed in the half-light—sturdy trousers, a faded shirt, boots
already caked with the red dust of the garden path. I filled a water
bottle from the tap, the water tasting of metal and deep earth. When I
stepped onto the porch, the world was still holding its breath. No
birdsong. Only the drip-drip from the broad leaves of the <em>pokok
keladi</em>, a measured, patient sound.</p>
<p>The house watched. In this pallid dawn, it did not look like a memory
or a weapon. It looked like a fact. A great, black jointed thing, its
eaves swallowing the weak light, its verandah a dark mouth. The post at
the corner, the one that had drunk the rain and whispered its secret,
was just a post again. A pillar of <em>belian</em>. But I knew its grain
now. I knew the song trapped in its rings.</p>
<p>I was not meeting Daniel until mid-morning. Time, first, to walk the
boundaries. To perform the land, as I had promised myself in the dark.
Not with the cold geometry of a theodolite, but with the older geometry
of story and step.</p>
<p>I started at the eastern edge, where the vegetable plots dissolved
into the wild tangle of ginger and wild pepper. The air here was spicy,
green. I walked slowly, my boots sinking into the soft mulch. I did not
just look. I listened with my skin. Here, the earth remembered the burn
of sunlight on bare soil, the press of my grandmother’s knees as she
weeded. The memory was not an image; it was a warmth, a particular
softness underfoot. I bent and sifted the soil through my fingers. It
was dark, rich, alive. I let it fall.</p>
<p><em>This is a garden</em>, I said to the quiet air. The words felt
insufficient, childish. But I said them again, in the old language.
<em>Ini kebun.</em></p>
<p>I moved south, skirting the line where the tended land gave way to
the secondary forest. The boundary was not a fence. It was a change in
the breath of the place. The garden breathed out—order, scent,
cultivation. The forest breathed in—a deep, damp inhalation of decay and
new growth. The line was a seam, stitched by the roots of a great
<em>pulai</em> tree, its buttresses flowing into the ground like frozen
rivers of wood.</p>
<p>I placed my palm against the cool, mossy skin of the <em>pulai</em>.
A pulse, slow and deep, thrummed up from the roots. Or perhaps it was my
own blood, beating in my ears. I closed my eyes.</p>
<p><em>This is a border</em>, I whispered. <em>Ini sempadan. Dijaga oleh
pokok.</em> Guarded by the tree.</p>
<p>The forest watched me from a few feet away. A wall of green so dense
it seemed solid. In its shadows, things moved. A rustle. A click. The
land here remembered different feet. The soft pad of a mouse deer. The
deliberate, heavy tread of a wild boar. The almost-silent passage of my
grandmother, collecting fungi or certain kinds of bark. Her memory was
here too, a lighter print, a disturbance in the pattern of
forgetting.</p>
<p>I followed the seam west, towards the back of the property where the
land began to slope upwards, a gentle rise that hinted at the mountains
far beyond. Here was the stream, the one that chuckled over smooth
stones. It was low now, a silver thread in a bed of damp, rounded rocks.
The sound it made was a private, liquid conversation with itself.</p>
<p>I knelt on the bank. The water was clear, cold. I cupped my hands and
drank. The taste was of stone and shadow, a clean, mineral truth. My
grandmother’s ledger had an entry about this stream. <em>Anak sungai ini
berubah lagu. Ia menyanyikan mimpi.</em> This stream-child changes its
song. It sings of dreams.</p>
<p><em>This is water</em>, I said to the flowing thread. <em>Ini air. Ia
ingat lagunya.</em> It remembers its song.</p>
<p>I rose, my knees damp, and continued. The western boundary was marked
by a row of old, gnarled durian trees, their branches arthritic against
the lightening sky. Their smell was not the sweet rot of champaca, but a
heavier, greener scent, like onions and cream. Beneath them, the earth
was bare, hard-packed from decades of fallen fruit.</p>
<p>And then I turned the corner, to the northern edge. This was the
front, facing the overgrown track that led to the world. Here, the land
was open, a sweep of wild grass giving way to the formal, crumbling
stone of the driveway and the looming presence of the <em>rumah
besar</em> itself. This was the public face. The claimable face. The
face a surveyor would see first.</p>
<p>I stood at the edge of the wild grass, looking at the house. From
this angle, it was a fortress. The verandah was a raised stage. The
windows were dark, sightless eyes. The silence around it was no longer
patient. It was declarative.</p>
<p>This was the boundary that mattered now. Not the one marked by tree
or stream, but the one marked by deed and desire. The line between the
story in the soil and the story on the paper.</p>
<p>A sound broke the stillness. Not from the forest, but from the track.
The grumble of an engine, the crunch of tires on gravel. Too early for
Daniel.</p>
<p>A white, mud-spattered four-wheel-drive emerged from the green tunnel
of overgrowth and came to a halt at the foot of the driveway. The engine
cut. The silence rushed back in, louder than before.</p>
<p>The driver’s door opened. A man stepped out. He was tall, European,
dressed in khaki field clothes that were too new, too crisp. He had a
narrow, assessing face, pale under a wide-brimmed hat. He didn’t see me
at first. He was looking at the house, his head tilted back, one hand
shading his eyes. His gaze was not one of appreciation, or historical
curiosity. It was a scan. A measurement. He was looking at timber, at
roof pitch, at structural potential.</p>
<p>Then his gaze swept the land and found me, a still figure at the edge
of the wild grass. He paused. He gave a short, professional smile that
did not reach his eyes. He reached back into the vehicle and pulled out
a long, aluminium case. A tripod. A theodolite.</p>
<p>The survey had not waited for a convenient day. It had come with the
bruise-coloured dawn.</p>
<p>He started up the driveway, his boots loud on the loose stone. I did
not move. I let him come. Let him cross the invisible line from the
track—the world of straight lines—onto the land itself. He stopped a few
yards from me, setting his case down with a soft thud.</p>
<p>“Miss Zainal?” His voice was accented. German, perhaps. It was
polite, devoid of inflection.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Klaus Richter. Geomatic surveyor. From Penang. We have an
appointment for the preliminary topographical and structural
assessment.” He said it as if reading from a work order. He looked past
me, at the durian trees, the forest edge. “We will begin with the
boundary markers. The existing ones, if they can be located.”</p>
<p>“There are no markers,” I said. My voice was quieter than his, but it
carried in the thick air. “Not the kind you are looking for.”</p>
<p>He blinked, his smile tightening. “The deed map indicates iron stakes
at the four corners. Placed in 1923.”</p>
<p>“The iron is gone. Eaten by the soil. Or taken.” I took a step
forward. “The boundaries are elsewhere.”</p>
<p>He looked at me properly now, his assessment shifting from the land
to me. I saw the calculation in his eyes. Educated. Emotional. Attached.
An obstacle to efficient work. “Miss Zainal, I understand this is a
sensitive place for you. But my job is to establish the legal, physical
parameters. According to the <em>pelan</em>.”</p>
<p>“The plan is wrong.”</p>
<p>He sighed, a short, controlled exhalation. “It is the document of
record. My instruments—” he gestured to the case, “—they do not measure
stories. They measure distance. Elevation. Angle.”</p>
<p>“Then they will measure a fiction,” I said. I turned and pointed
towards the <em>pulai</em> tree. “The true eastern line is the third
buttress root of that tree. It has been for a hundred and twenty years.
Since the great wind.” I pointed to the stream. “The southern line
follows the song of the water. Where the high note is, near the flat
rock. That is the turn.” I pointed to the durian trees. “The western
line is the breath of the durian. Where the smell is strongest at noon.
That is the corner.” Finally, I pointed to the ground at my feet. “And
here. This spot. Where the grass is always a different green. This is
the northern point. It remembers a gate that was never built.”</p>
<p>Richter was silent for a long moment. He looked from my face to the
places I had indicated, then back to my face. His professional
detachment had cracked, revealing a faint, cold irritation. “That is…
poetic. But it is not surveyable data. I must work with what is on the
map. What can be verified.”</p>
<p>“Verify that,” I said, and my voice was no longer quiet. It was the
voice of the root, holding fast. “Put your instrument here. See if the
ground agrees with your paper.”</p>
<p>A flicker of something—uncertainty, perhaps—crossed his face. He was
a man of numbers, of laser lines and GPS coordinates. He dealt in the
certainties of reflected light. The certainty of a different green in
the grass was a language he did not speak, and therefore, a language he
dismissed.</p>
<p>“I will begin at the approximate location of the historical northeast
stake,” he said, his tone final. He bent, opened his case, and began
assembling his theodolite, the aluminium limbs clicking together with a
sound of pure, sterile precision.</p>
<p>I watched him. The invasion was not dramatic. It was a series of
small, precise actions. The tripod legs, extending, their sharp feet
pressing into the earth near my feet. The instrument, mounted, its lens
a blank, glassy eye. He peered through it, adjusted a knob. A low hum
emanated from the device. He was taking a reading from a satellite in
the void, using it to fix this point of living earth to a grid that
spanned the globe.</p>
<p>He was drawing his line. And in doing so, he was erasing mine.</p>
<p>I did not argue further. Arguing with his language, on his terms, was
a surrender. I simply stood there, a few feet away, and performed my own
survey. I felt the memory in the soil under his tripod feet. This was
where the old gatepost was to have stood. My great-grandfather had cut
the timber, but then the dream had come—the one about the mountain
needing a clear view—and the post was never planted. The earth here had
held the expectation for a century. It was a memory of an absence, a
shape that never was. A potent kind of truth.</p>
<p>Richter noted something on a rugged tablet computer. He moved the
tripod, ten paces to the side. The feet stabbed into the earth
again.</p>
<p>I followed, a silent shadow. He was tracing the boundary of the
fiction. I was tracing the boundary of the memory. We were two ghosts,
walking overlapping but entirely different lands.</p>
<p>For an hour, we performed this duet. The hum of his electronic
equipment. The crunch of his boots. My silent steps. The occasional,
soft utterance from me in the old language, naming what he was stepping
on. <em>Ini tempat mimpi.</em> This is the place of the dream. <em>Ini
jejak rusa.</em> This is the deer’s track.</p>
<p>He ignored me. But his shoulders grew tighter. His movements more
abrupt. The silence I wielded was a pressure. The specificity of my
whispers was a corrosion on his certainty. He was here to simplify, to
reduce. I was here to complexify, to expand. We were antithetical
forces.</p>
<p>He was near the stream, setting up for another measurement, when
Daniel arrived. I saw him first, a movement at the edge of the forest
path. He emerged into the open, his satchel over his shoulder, his eyes
taking in the scene: the surveyor with his machine, me standing like a
sentinel nearby. He stopped. His expression, usually one of open
curiosity, hardened into something guarded, alert.</p>
<p>He walked over to me, not to Richter. “He’s early,” Daniel said, his
voice low.</p>
<p>“The law does not keep garden hours,” I replied.</p>
<p>Daniel looked at the theodolite, its lens now pointed at the roof of
the <em>rumah besar</em>. “What’s he doing?”</p>
<p>“Translating the land into numbers. Making it legible for the
court.”</p>
<p>Richter straightened up, noticing Daniel. He gave the same brief,
impersonal nod. “You are with the historical trust?”</p>
<p>“I’m a researcher,” Daniel said, not offering a name. “Documenting
the site.”</p>
<p>“Good. You can confirm there are no physical boundary markers? No
iron stakes?”</p>
<p>Daniel glanced at me. I gave a slight shake of my head. “I haven’t
seen any,” Daniel said carefully.</p>
<p>Richter made another note. “As I thought. We will have to establish
new control points. Based on the deed.” He looked at the house again.
“The structural assessment is next. I will need full access to the
interior. To assess beam integrity, foundation settlement.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>Both men looked at me.</p>
<p>“The house is not ready for your kind of measurement,” I continued.
“Its integrity is not in its beams. It is in its silence. You will not
go inside today.”</p>
<p>Richter’s patience, thin to begin with, snapped. “Miss Zainal, this
is a legal requirement. The trust’s insurance, the valuation—all
dependent on a proper survey. You are obstructing.”</p>
<p>“I am clarifying,” I said. “You can measure the outside. You can walk
your lines. But the inside of the house… it is a different climate. Your
machines will not work properly in there.”</p>
<p>It was not a threat. It was a statement of fact, delivered in the
same tone he used for his technical specifications. The house’s interior
held its breath, its memories packed tight as tobacco in a jar. A
theodolite’ laser would get lost in that density. A level would find no
true horizontal, only the settled comfort of decades.</p>
<p>Daniel was watching me, a new understanding dawning in his eyes. He
was remembering the ledger, the post, the whispering rain. He saw I was
not being merely difficult. I was enforcing a different physics.</p>
<p>Richter scoffed, a short, dry sound. “This is ridiculous. I have a
job to do.”</p>
<p>“Then do the part of it that belongs to the outside world,” I said.
“The boundary. The roof line. Leave the interior to itself.”</p>
<p>We stood in a triangle of opposing wills. Richter, with the authority
of paper and protocol. Daniel, the observer caught in the middle, his
allegiance shifting invisibly from institution to the inexplicable truth
of the place. And me, the root, feeling the tension run through me into
the ground.</p>
<p>Finally, Richter threw up his hands. “Fine. For now. External only.
But this will be noted. The trust will be informed of your
non-cooperation.” He turned his back on us, a deliberate dismissal, and
bent to his instrument again, peering through the eyepiece as if seeking
refuge in its clean, mathematical world.</p>
<p>Daniel exhaled slowly. “He’s not going to understand,” he
murmured.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t have to,” I said. “He just has to be unable to complete
his picture. A puzzle with a missing piece is still a puzzle. It cannot
be acted upon.”</p>
<p>“And what do we do?”</p>
<p>“We complete ours,” I said, looking towards the house. “We walk the
story. You have your recorder?”</p>
<p>He patted his satchel.</p>
<p>“Good. Today, we don’t just listen. We document. We make a record he
cannot ignore. Not of dimensions, but of testimony.”</p>
<p>We left Richter to his solitary, frustrated measurements, a man
trying to capture a shadow with a net made of light. Daniel and I
crossed the driveway, our footsteps silent on the moss-flecked stones of
the path to the verandah steps.</p>
<p>Up close, in the flat morning light, the house’s readiness was
palpable. It was not a passive waiting. It was a coiled attention. The
<em>belian</em> wood seemed to drink the sound of Richter’s distant
activities, leaving a pocket of profound quiet around us. The air on the
verandah was cooler, still carrying the ghost of last night’s rain-smell
from the secret post.</p>
<p>I took the heavy key from my pocket. It was warm now, from my skin. I
fitted it into the lock of the great carved door. The mechanism turned
with a sound that was not a click, but a deep, oiled <em>thunk</em>,
like a bone settling into a socket.</p>
<p>The door swung inward.</p>
<p>The smell that rushed out was not must or decay. It was the smell of
held time. Of polished wood, faint camphor, dried roses, and the
particular, papery scent of old ledgers and photographs. It was the
smell of breath held for decades.</p>
<p>Sunlight, weak and filtered by the dirt-streaked windows, fell in
slanted bars across the floor of the central hall. Dust motes danced in
the beams, slow and graceful as underwater creatures. The house was not
empty. It was full—not of furniture, though there were pieces shrouded
in white cloth like sleeping ghosts—but of presence. The high ceiling
vanished into shadow. The staircase swept up into darkness.</p>
<p>I stepped across the threshold. The floorboards, wide planks of
deep-red <em>chengal</em>, did not creak. They sighed. A soft, yielding
sound, as if acknowledging a familiar weight.</p>
<p>Daniel followed, his movements hesitant, reverent. He had his
recorder out, a small, black device in his palm. He did not switch it on
yet. He was absorbing the climate.</p>
<p>“Where do we start?” His voice was a whisper, instinctively
muted.</p>
<p>“Here,” I said, standing in the centre of the hall. I closed my eyes.
I did not need to see. I needed to feel the currents. The house had a
geography of memory, just as the land did. “The centre is the heart. The
stories pool here. But they flow from the edges. From the rooms where
people lived.”</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and turned to the left, to a doorway leading to what
I knew was the old sitting room. “We follow the flow.”</p>
<p>The sitting room was a capsule of suspended life. A sofa, shrouded. A
low table. A bookshelf filled with volumes whose spines were cracked and
gold-lettered. On the wall, a photograph in a tarnished silver frame: my
grandmother as a young woman, standing straight-backed beside a man I
did not recognise—my grandfather, perhaps—in front of a car with
sweeping fenders. They were not smiling. Their faces were serious, full
of a quiet certainty.</p>
<p>I pointed to the photograph. “That is one truth,” I said to Daniel.
“The truth of a moment, posed for the camera. But the truth of this
room…” I walked to the window. The sill was deep. The wood on the right
side was smoother, darker, worn by the repeated pressure of an elbow.
“The truth is here. This is where she sat, every afternoon when the rain
came. Watching the garden drink. Not reading. Not sewing. Just watching.
This is where she listened to the house digest the weather.”</p>
<p>Daniel raised his recorder. A small red light glowed. “May I?”</p>
<p>I nodded. I placed my own elbow in the smooth hollow. The fit was
perfect. A generational echo. “This sill,” I said, my voice finding a
rhythm that was not quite my own, a slower, more deliberate cadence. “It
is not just wood. It is a listening post. The memory here is not of an
event, but of a habit of attention. A daily ritual of communion between
the woman and the monsoon. The grain remembers the pressure of her
watchfulness.”</p>
<p>I moved to the bookshelf. I did not pull out a book. I ran my finger
along the spaces between the volumes. “The books are silent. But the
gaps… here, and here… these are where the favourites lived. Taken out,
returned, taken out again. The gaps are more alive than the books that
remain. They are the shape of preference, of repeated love. One was a
book of poetry. The other, a treatise on native orchids. The stories she
needed most.”</p>
<p>Daniel was capturing it all, his eyes wide, not on me, but on the
spaces I indicated—the worn sill, the gaps on the shelf. He was learning
to see the negative space, the architecture of absence.</p>
<p>We moved to the dining room. A long table, shrouded. A sideboard. But
my attention went to the corner, where the wall met the floor. There was
a slight discolouration in the wood, a dark stain shaped like a distant
mountain range.</p>
<p>“A leak,” Daniel said softly.</p>
<p>“A conversation,” I corrected. I knelt. “The roof let the rain in,
here, for one season only. The year my father was born. It was not
repaired immediately. My grandmother said the house was weeping its own
blessing onto the floor, marking the spot where the new cry had entered
the world. They let it stain. They called it the <em>tanda air
berkat</em>. The mark of blessed water.” I touched the stain. It was
smooth, cool. “It is not damage. It is a baptismal record. Written in
tannin and time.”</p>
<p>Room by room, we performed this archaeology of meaning. The kitchen,
where the memory was of heat and sizzle and the particular sound of a
pestle against a stone mortar—the rhythm was worn into the very air, a
percussive ghost. A bedroom, where the memory was not of sleep, but of
fever—the window latch was worn shiny from being opened night after
night to let in the cool air for a burning child. My father? An uncle?
The house did not give up names. Only the shape of care.</p>
<p>Daniel’s recorder was filling with a new kind of data. Not dates, not
dimensions. The texture of attention. The grammar of use. The prose of
lived life written into wood and wear.</p>
<p>Finally, we stood at the bottom of the staircase. It curved up into
the second-storey gloom, its banister a polished serpent of dark
wood.</p>
<p>“The private spaces,” I said. “The dreams.”</p>
<p>I led the way up. The stairs sighed differently here, a more intimate
sound. The upper floor was a corridor of closed doors, the air even
closer, thicker with memory. These were the chambers of solitude, of
sickness, of secret joys.</p>
<p>I did not open all the doors. Some thresholds felt too private, even
for me, the heir. But one door, at the end of the corridor, drew me. It
was narrower than the others, its paint a faded blue.</p>
<p>My grandmother’s room.</p>
<p>The key for this one was on a separate ring, smaller, colder. It
turned with resistance. The door opened onto stillness.</p>
<p>This room was not shrouded. It was preserved. A single bed, neatly
made with a faded <em>kain pelikat</em>. A simple wooden dressing table
with a three-panel mirror. A wardrobe. A prayer mat rolled neatly in the
corner. The window looked out over the back garden, the forest a green
wall in the distance.</p>
<p>The air here was different. It held her scent, or the memory of it—a
clean smell of sandalwood soap and pressed cotton. It was not a sad
smell. It was a present smell.</p>
<p>Daniel hung back at the doorway, understanding this was a sanctum. I
entered alone.</p>
<p>The silence here was a companion. I walked to the dressing table. The
surface was bare except for a single, tortoiseshell hairbrush. A few
long, grey hairs were still caught in its bristles. I did not remove
them. They were part of the record.</p>
<p>In the mirror, I saw my own reflection, superimposed over the room. I
looked tired, my eyes dark, my face serious. For a fleeting second, the
reflection seemed to shift, to show an older face, a straighter back. A
trick of the dim, dusty light.</p>
<p>I turned from the mirror. Against the wall, beside the bed, was a
small, low writing desk. On it sat a lacquer box, inlaid with
mother-of-pearl in a design of twisting vines. I knew this box. She had
kept her most personal things in it. Letters. A broken watch. A dried
sprig of some herb.</p>
<p>I lifted the lid. The faint scent of cedar and old paper rose up.</p>
<p>There were no love letters. No diaries. At the top was a map. Not a
printed surveyor’s map, but one drawn by hand on thick, creamy paper.
The ink was faded brown. It was a map of the land, but not as Richter
would see it. It showed the <em>rumah besar</em>. The stream, drawn as a
curling blue line. The <em>pulai</em> tree, rendered with careful roots.
The durian row. And notations, in my grandmother’s hand, in the old
language.</p>
<p><em>Di silah, semangat rumput berbisik.</em> Here, the spirit of the
grass whispers. <em>Batu ini panas ketika hujan akan datang.</em> This
stone is warm when rain is coming. <em>Sempadan mimpi.</em> The dream
boundary.</p>
<p>It was a psychic survey. A map of meanings. A key to the living
document of the land.</p>
<p>Beneath it was a single sheet of paper, folded small. I opened it. It
was a letter, written in English, in a tight, formal hand that was not
my grandmother’s. The date at the top was 1957. The year of
independence.</p>
<p><em>To Cik Fatimah Zainal,</em></p>
<p><em>Further to our discussion, I must reiterate the offer from the
Land Office remains firm and final. The alignment of the new access road
is fixed. The compulsory purchase order for the northern strip of your
property, measuring approximately one quarter-acre, is enclosed. The
compensation is calculated at the standard rate for agricultural
land.</em></p>
<p><em>I understand your… attachment… to the existing layout. However,
progress cannot be hindered by sentiment. The road will bring
development, electricity, modernity to the region. Your cooperation is
expected.</em></p>
<p><em>Yours,</em> <em>R. Davenport, Asst. District Officer.</em></p>
<p>My blood ran cold. A compulsory purchase. A road. This had happened
before.</p>
<p>And beneath that letter, a second one, in my grandmother’s own
flowing script. A draft of a reply, never sent, or perhaps a copy of one
that was.</p>
<p><em>To Mr. Davenport,</em></p>
<p><em>You speak of progress as if it is a river that must flow in a
straight line. My land is not a channel for your water. It is a living
body. You ask me to cut off its limb for your convenience. I will
not.</em></p>
<p><em>The road you propose will not pass here. It will find another
way, or it will not be built. The trees will not allow it. The stream
will not allow it. The memory in the soil will not allow it.</em></p>
<p><em>You have your maps. I have mine. We will see which one the land
recognises.</em></p>
<p><em>Fatimah Zainal.</em></p>
<p>I held the two letters, the official threat and the defiant, rooted
response. The past was not just repeating itself. It was providing the
script. The same battle, different actors. The straight line against the
living curve. The paper claim against the map of meanings.</p>
<p>“Ameena?” Daniel’s voice was soft from the doorway.</p>
<p>I turned, the papers in my hand. I didn’t need to explain. He saw it
on my face—the shock, the dawning fury, the grim recognition.</p>
<p>“They tried before,” I said, my voice hollow. “They tried to cut a
road through. To take a piece.”</p>
<p>Daniel came into the room, took the letters, read them. His
historian’s mind made the connections instantly. “This changes the
narrative,” he said, his voice rising with excitement. “This shows a
pattern. A historical attempt to appropriate, resisted successfully by a
private citizen citing… non-legal grounds. Ecological, spiritual
grounds. It’s a precedent.”</p>
<p>“It’s a warning,” I said. “And a lesson. She didn’t fight them with
lawyers. She fought them with a deeper truth. She made her map, and she
held her ground. And the road…?”</p>
<p>“I know this area,” Daniel said, thinking. “The main road curves two
miles to the west. It’s an inconvenient detour. Legends say the original
surveyors kept finding their markers moved, their instruments
malfunctioning whenever they tried to plot the straight path through
this valley.”</p>
<p>“Not legends,” I said, looking out the window at the unbroken green.
“History.”</p>
<p>I placed the letters and the hand-drawn map back in the lacquer box.
They were no longer just memories. They were evidence. Of a different
kind. Evidence of a will. A territorial claim written not in law, but in
belief and sustained by something stronger than ink.</p>
<p>We left the room, closing the door gently on its preserved air. The
descent down the staircase felt like a return from a deep dive. The air
in the main hall seemed lighter, but charged with new purpose.</p>
<p>The front door was open. Richter was outside, packing his equipment
into the back of his vehicle. He looked up as we emerged onto the
verandah. His face was set in lines of frustration.</p>
<p>“Finished?” I asked.</p>
<p>“For today,” he said curtly. “The external data is sufficient for a
preliminary model. But the interior assessment is mandatory. I will be
back with a representative from the trust. And possibly a court order,
if you continue to refuse access.” He slammed the rear door of his
vehicle. “You cannot stop progress with stories, Miss Zainal.”</p>
<p>I looked at him, and for the first time, I felt not anger, but a
cold, clear pity. He was a functionary of a world that believed only in
surfaces. He would never hear the sigh in the floorboards, never see the
baptism in the water stain. He would only ever measure the ghost, and
miss the spirit entirely.</p>
<p>“You are right,” I said, my voice calm. “I cannot stop it with
stories. But the land can. The house can. And I am not just telling
stories, Mr. Richter. I am becoming one.”</p>
<p>He stared at me, uncomprehending. Then he shook his head, got into
his vehicle, and started the engine. The sound was a violent intrusion.
He reversed, turned, and disappeared down the track, leaving a cloud of
red dust that hung in the still air before slowly settling back onto the
land it belonged to.</p>
<p>The silence after his departure was profound. A reclaiming.</p>
<p>Daniel stood beside me on the verandah. “What now?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Now,” I said, watching the dust settle, “we make our case. Not to
the court. Not yet. First, we make it to the land itself. We show it we
remember. We show it we understand the old map.” I turned to him. “We
need to find the stone. The one that is warm when the rain comes.”</p>
<p>He nodded, no longer just a researcher, but an initiate. “The map
mentioned it. Near the stream?”</p>
<p>“Near the turn. Where the song is a high note.”</p>
<p>The afternoon sun was finally breaking through the bruise-coloured
clouds, casting long, sharp shadows. The garden steamed gently. The
house, behind us, seemed to settle, its watchfulness easing slightly. It
had been seen. Its memories had been witnessed, recorded in a new,
technological ledger. The duel of documents had begun.</p>
<p>But as Daniel and I walked off the verandah, heading back towards the
stream with the hand-drawn map as our guide, I knew the real battle was
just being joined. Richter’s lines were drawn on a screen. My
grandmother’s lines were drawn in memory, in song, in the warmth of a
stone.</p>
<p>The surveyor would return with the weight of law. I had to return
with the weight of a deeper, older truth. I had to make the land perform
its identity so forcefully that any line drawn upon it would seem, by
comparison, a pale and laughable fiction.</p>
<p>The mountain was silent. The house was remembering. And I, the root,
felt the first tremor of the coming wind—not a monsoon, but a gale of
papers and petitions—and I began, silently, to dig deeper.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-15-1">CHAPTER 15</h2>
<p>The stream’s song had changed. It was no longer the low, clear
chuckle of the morning, but a sharper, more insistent melody, a thread
of silver sound pulled taut over the stones. The afternoon light,
fractured by the canopy, lay in broken coins on the water. We walked
beside it, Daniel a half-step behind, his presence a quiet counterpoint
to the land’s rising voice. The map in my hands was not paper, but skin.
My grandmother’s notations—<em>di sini bunyi tinggi</em>, here the sound
is high; <em>tanah lembut</em>, soft earth—were not instructions. They
were reminders. A language the body had forgotten how to speak, but the
blood still understood.</p>
<p>“The turn should be just ahead,” Daniel said, his voice hushed. He
had stopped taking notes. The recorder in his pocket was off. This part
of the work required a different kind of recording.</p>
<p>The path bent, following the stream’s elbow. The air grew cooler,
damper, the smell of wet stone and cold root rising to meet us. The
frantic green of the jungle receded here, giving way to older, slower
things: moss like emerald velvet on boulders, the skeletal fingers of a
fallen <em>meranti</em> tree slowly becoming earth. This was a place of
transition, where water turned and the land remembered its bones.</p>
<p>And there it was. Not a marker, not an altar. A fact.</p>
<p>It rose from a cradle of ferns beside the water’s edge, a shoulder of
dark grey granite veined with threads of quartz that caught the light
like frozen lightning. It was larger than it had seemed in my
grandmother’s story, a dormant beast half-sunk in the loam. There was
nothing ceremonial about it. Its power was in its plain, obstinate
<em>thereness</em>.</p>
<p>“The <em>batu hangat</em>,” I said. The warm stone.</p>
<p>We approached slowly. The stream’s high note seemed to emanate from
the stone itself, a vibration in the air. I knelt before it, not in
reverence, but in reconnaissance. My palms hovered an inch above its
surface. It was not warm. Not yet.</p>
<p>“The story said it heats <em>before</em> the rain,” Daniel murmured,
crouching beside me. He glanced at the sky, a mosaic of blue and white
through the leaves. “No sign of it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not about the sky,” I said. “It’s about the ground. The water
underneath. The stone knows what the roots know.”</p>
<p>My grandmother’s voice, a ghost in my inner ear: <em>The land has a
pulse, Mina. Slower than ours. You must listen with your feet.</em></p>
<p>I placed my hands flat on the stone. It was cool, almost cold, the
granite drinking the warmth from my skin. I closed my eyes. Not to pray.
To listen. To feel for that slower pulse. Beneath the chatter of the
stream, the sigh of the trees, there was a silence. A deep, humming
silence. It was the sound of waiting.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. “We need the other part of the map.”</p>
<p>Daniel unrolled the larger, hand-drawn sheet on a dry patch of
ground. It was a tapestry of practical observation and poetic intuition.
A dotted line marked the stream. A small ‘X’ marked our stone. And
leading away from it, a series of gentle curves annotated in my
grandmother’s tight script: <em>jalan ingatan</em>. The path of
memory.</p>
<p>It did not lead deeper into the jungle. It led back, in a wide, slow
arc, towards the western boundary of the property—the very edge
Richter’s drone had mapped, the line he intended to sever.</p>
<p>“She wasn’t just marking a stream,” I said, my finger tracing the
path. “She was mapping a relationship. The stone, the water, this path…
it’s a circuit. A story in the land.”</p>
<p>“A story that proves continuity of use,” Daniel said, the researcher
in him finally connecting to the mystic. “If we can demonstrate this
path, this… this ritual geography, is integral to the identity of the
place, maintained across generations…”</p>
<p>“It’s not ritual,” I corrected, softly. “It’s respiration. The land
breathes this way. She was just noting the breath.”</p>
<p>We followed the <em>jalan ingatan</em>. It was not a cleared path. It
was a suggestion. A certain spacing between trees, a particular softness
underfoot where generations of feet had pressed the mulch into a sponge.
Sometimes it vanished entirely, and we had to stop, consult the map, and
look for the next clue: a tree with a distinctive twist in its trunk, a
rock shaped like a sleeping turtle. It was a map made for those already
willing to believe the land was speaking.</p>
<p>As we walked, I spoke. Not to Daniel, but to the trees, to the
silence. I spoke in the old language, the village Malay woven with
older, forgotten words my grandmother had used like secret keys. Words
for the quality of light before a storm, for the smell of a particular
leaf crushed between fingers, for the sound of a specific bird that
meant water was near. I was not recalling vocabulary. I was exhaling
memory. The words felt strange in my mouth, thick and sweet as jungle
fruit. They were not London words. They were <em>rumah besar</em>
words.</p>
<p>Daniel walked beside me, a witness. His silence was a vessel.</p>
<p>The path ended at a wall.</p>
<p>Not a natural feature, but a man-made one, or rather, a
<em>nature-assisted</em> one. A low, crumbling line of laterite bricks,
furred with moss, barely knee-high, snaking through the undergrowth. It
was so old it seemed less a construction than a geological event, a slow
red blush on the skin of the forest. It marked the western boundary.</p>
<p>And here, the map showed a small circle. The annotation: <em>tempat
dengar</em>. The listening place.</p>
<p>I stepped over the low wall. The earth felt different. Not hostile,
but… attentive. The birdsong dropped away. We stood in a small, natural
clearing where a ring of <em>tapang</em> trees grew in a near-perfect
circle, their high, wide canopies creating a green cathedral roof. In
the centre, the earth was bare, a compacted disc of dark soil.</p>
<p>This was not a place for building. It was a place for standing. For
receiving.</p>
<p>“My grandmother’s father would bring her here,” I said, my voice
barely a whisper in the hushed air. “When the negotiations for the
timber rights were happening. When the British surveyors were first
drawing their lines. He would stand here, he said, and listen for the
land’s opinion.”</p>
<p>“And?” Daniel asked, his own voice subdued.</p>
<p>“The land,” I said, repeating the words I’d heard a hundred times in
a kitchen smelling of ginger and woodsmoke, “was not impressed.”</p>
<p>A breeze moved through the <em>tapang</em> trees, a soft exhalation
that made the high leaves shiver. In that moment, I felt it. Not a
sound, but a pressure. A deep, sub-audible hum, like the lowest note of
a cello played miles away. It vibrated in the hollow of my chest, in the
roots of my teeth. It was the mountain. It was the memory of the
mountain. The aggregate whisper of every root, every stone, every drop
of water that had ever belonged to this slope.</p>
<p>This was the evidence that could not be filed. The truth that could
not be notarized. Richter’s lines were a fantasy drawn on the skin of a
sleeping giant. This hum was the giant’s breath.</p>
<p>But the law did not deal in breath. It dealt in deeds. In fences. In
the violent poetry of coordinates.</p>
<p>As we stood in the listening place, the first fat, warm drop of rain
hit my forehead. Then another on my arm. The sky had not darkened, but
the rain had come anyway, born from the mountain’s own exhaled humidity.
The monsoon was speaking in afterthoughts.</p>
<p>“The stone,” Daniel said.</p>
<p>We moved quickly, retracing our steps along the memory path, now
under a gentle, sunlit rain. The jungle came alive with a thousand tiny
percussions. By the time we reached the turn in the stream, the rain was
steady, a gauzy curtain softening the world.</p>
<p>The granite stone was steaming.</p>
<p>Not metaphorically. Fine tendrils of vapour rose from its surface,
where the warm rain met the now-warm rock. I knelt again, heedless of
the wet earth soaking through my trousers. I placed both hands on it. A
deep, gentle heat radiated from the core of the stone, a stored warmth
from a sun it had absorbed days ago, now released on cue by the rain’s
touch. It was exactly as she had said. A truth of the body, not the
mind.</p>
<p>Daniel placed his hand beside mine. He inhaled sharply. “It’s… it’s
true.”</p>
<p>“It was always true,” I said. But the wonder in his voice was a kind
of fuel. He had moved from belief to knowledge. He had felt the archive
in the stone.</p>
<p>We documented it. This time, the camera clicked, the recorder ran. We
captured the vapour, measured the temperature differential with a
thermometer from Daniel’s pack, noted the exact time and rainfall. We
collected the empirical poetry of it. This was our first exhibit. Not
just a story, but a verifiable, repeatable phenomenon of the land—a
phenomenon my grandmother’s map had predicted. A thread in the tapestry
of deep knowledge.</p>
<p>The walk back to the <em>rumah besar</em> was a quiet triumph. The
rain eased, leaving the world glistening. The house came into view
through the trees, its black wood drinking the wet light, solid and
patient. It had watched us go, and now it watched us return, bearing a
fragment of its own truth.</p>
<p>But the house was not the only watcher.</p>
<p>As we emerged from the tree line near the overgrown lawn, a figure
stood on the verandah. Not Richter. A woman. She was tall,
straight-backed, dressed in a simple, elegant batik tunic and slacks.
Her grey hair was swept into a severe bun. She held herself with the
absolute stillness of someone who had been waiting a very long time.</p>
<p>Amina Hassan. The chairwoman of the historical trust. The woman whose
signature I needed, whose approval would sanctify the property’s
preservation. She had come unannounced.</p>
<p>Daniel hung back instinctively, sensing a shift in the weather. I
walked towards the verandah, the warmth of the stone still lingering in
my palms.</p>
<p>“Miss Zainal,” she said. Her voice was like the <em>belian</em>
wood—hard, polished, giving nothing away.</p>
<p>“Puan Amina. This is unexpected.”</p>
<p>“I find appointments breed performance,” she said, her eyes scanning
me, the house, the dripping garden. “I prefer to see the truth of a
thing. And the truth of this place is… complicated.”</p>
<p>“It is,” I agreed, mounting the steps. “Would you like to come
inside?”</p>
<p>She shook her head once, a sharp, economical movement. “Here is fine.
The air is clear.” She paused. “I received a courtesy copy of a
preliminary survey report. From a German concern. Their lines are very…
bold.”</p>
<p>So Richter had already begun his campaign. A pre-emptive strike.</p>
<p>“They are lines drawn in ignorance,” I said, keeping my voice
level.</p>
<p>“Ignorance is the foundation of most legal claims,” she replied.
There was no malice in it, only a weary certainty. “My trust values
history, Miss Zainal. But we are a practical entity. We preserve what is
<em>definable</em>. A house. A garden. A documented lineage. We are not
equipped to preserve… feelings. Or stories.”</p>
<p>“What if the story is the history?” I asked. “What if the feeling is
the only true map?”</p>
<p>She looked at me then, really looked, her dark eyes missing nothing.
The London in my accent, the jungle mud on my shoes, the defiant set of
my shoulders. “You sound like your grandmother.”</p>
<p>“I am her root.”</p>
<p>A faint, almost imperceptible softening around her mouth. “She was a
formidable woman. A poet of the practical. She understood that to keep a
thing, you must sometimes build a cage of paperwork around it.” She
sighed, a small, tired sound. “The German offer is substantial. Their
arguments are clean. Your defence, as I understand it, is… moist. It is
made of rain and warm stones and songs. The court will laugh. My board
will yawn.”</p>
<p>The triumph by the stream curdled in my stomach. She was not an
enemy. She was a realist. And realism was the weapon our world had
perfected.</p>
<p>“Give me a week,” I said, the words out before I could measure them.
“Before you make any recommendation to your board. Give me a week to
show you that the paperwork and the rain are the same thing. That the
cage must be built from the same wood as the tree it protects.”</p>
<p>She was silent for a long moment, studying the façade of the
<em>rumah besar</em>. “This house is a memory of a way of building that
is gone. That is what we preserve. The <em>fact</em> of it. Not the… the
ecosystem of memory it sits in.”</p>
<p>“The house is not a fact,” I said, a sudden heat in my voice. “It is
a consequence. It is what happens when the land allows itself to be
shaped. Without the land’s consent, it is just a pile of dead wood. And
that,” I pointed past her, towards the listening place, towards the warm
stone, “that is what gives consent. The old map.”</p>
<p>Amina Hassan followed my gaze, seeing nothing but green. Then she
looked back at me. “One week,” she said finally. “Not out of hope. Out
of respect for Laila Zainal’s ghost. Show me a fact I can hold. Not a
story I must believe.”</p>
<p>She gave a slight, formal nod, then walked down the verandah steps
and across the gravel to a waiting, unmarked sedan. She did not look
back.</p>
<p>Daniel approached as the car disappeared. “One week?”</p>
<p>“One week,” I echoed, the weight of it settling on me. “To translate
a world into a language they can understand.”</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon was a fever of planning. We spread every
document, every map, every photograph across the great table in the main
hall. The old and the new lay side by side: the hand-drawn <em>jalan
ingatan</em> and the sterile GIS printouts from Daniel’s laptop; my
grandmother’s diary entries about the stone and the rainfall charts we’d
started to keep. We had to create a new kind of document. A bridge.</p>
<p>“We need to make the implicit, explicit,” Daniel said, his fingers
flying over his keyboard. “We need to show correlation, then causation.
We need to prove that traditional knowledge isn’t superstition—it’s
predictive science.”</p>
<p>“It’s more than science,” I argued, pacing. “It’s identity. The
land’s identity.”</p>
<p>“But the law needs the science to get to the identity,” he said,
looking up. “We have to lead them there step by logical step. The warm
stone is a thermal anomaly linked to hydrology. The listening place is a
unique acoustic environment created by the tree formation and subsoil
composition. The path is a sustained, generations-long pattern of land
use.”</p>
<p>He was right. It felt like dissection. Like pinning a butterfly to a
board and calling the arrangement truth. But it was the only language
that had power in the rooms where decisions were made.</p>
<p>As dusk fell, we drafted an outline. A “Statement of Deep
Topography,” we called it. A document that would layer Richter’s
two-dimensional lines with a third dimension—time—and a fourth—memory.
We would use his own technology against him, plotting the points from my
grandmother’s map onto his digital survey, showing how the “ritual”
sites corresponded to specific, verifiable geological and hydrological
features. We would demonstrate that the boundary he wanted to cut was
not a line between two plots, but a suture through a living tissue.</p>
<p>It was late when Daniel finally left for the caretaker’s cottage, his
eyes bright with exhausted focus. I remained in the hall. The single
bulb cast a poor, yellow light that made the shadows in the corners
deeper. The house was silent, but it was the silence of held breath.</p>
<p>I was not enough. A week was not enough. The task was a mountain, and
I was digging with a spoon.</p>
<p>A sound pulled me from the edge of despair. A soft, rhythmic
scraping. Not the house. Not the jungle. It came from the direction of
the old study.</p>
<p>I took the oil lamp and walked towards it. The door was ajar. The
scraping was clearer here—the sound of a stiff brush on wood.</p>
<p>I pushed the door open.</p>
<p>The room was empty. But on my grandmother’s vast, empty desk, the
dust had been disturbed. Not by random settling. By design.</p>
<p>Someone, or something, had brushed the dust into lines. Not words. A
shape. A rough, unmistakable outline. It was a map. A simplified,
skeletal version of the <em>jalan ingatan</em>. And at its heart, where
the listening place would be, the dust was not brushed flat. It was
gathered into a small, neat mound.</p>
<p>A cold clarity washed over me, colder than the stone before the rain.
I had been thinking like a petitioner. Like a scholar building a
case.</p>
<p>The house was not suggesting a case. It was suggesting an action.</p>
<p>The listening place was not just for listening. The mound of dust was
a marker. A pointer.</p>
<p>Something was there. Buried. Not a truth to be argued. A truth to be
<em>unearned</em>.</p>
<p>My grandmother had not just mapped the land’s breath. She had hidden
its heart. And she had waited for the moment the law’s blade was at the
throat to reveal where.</p>
<p>The week’s work had just changed. It was no longer about
translation.</p>
<p>It was about excavation.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-16-1">CHAPTER 16</h2>
<p>The map in the dust was a ghost of intention. It did not linger. The
air from the open door, a slow, warm exhalation from the hallway, was
already blurring its edges, graining the sharp lines of the <em>jalan
ingatan</em> into soft, meaningless smudges. Only the small mound at the
heart of the sketch held its form, a tiny cairn of powdered time.</p>
<p>I did not move to preserve it. Preservation was the instinct of the
archivist, the keeper of dead things. This was not dead. It was a
signal, passed from one state of being to another, and its ephemeral
nature was the point. It was meant to be seen once, understood, and then
surrendered to the house’s slow metabolism. My grandmother had not
written a note. She had drawn a breath, and let it mist a glass.</p>
<p>The oil lamp guttered, painting the walls with lunging shadows. The
study felt like a cavity recently emptied. The scraping that had drawn
me here was gone, absorbed back into the silence, but the quality of the
quiet had changed. It was no longer a held breath. It was a breath
released, a waiting ended. The house had delivered its instruction. The
rest was up to me.</p>
<p>I turned from the desk. The week’s work, Daniel’s careful charts, the
solicitor’s threats—they were the surface chatter of a world that
believed itself real. Beneath it, the older logic was at work. The
boundary dispute was not a legal problem. It was a symptom. A body
fighting an infection. The land was sick where the developer’s line
would cut, and it was rallying its defences. My grandmother had buried a
poultice. A truth to draw the poison.</p>
<p>I walked back to the main hall, my footsteps the only sound in the
vast throat of the <em>rumah besar</em>. Daniel’s survey papers were
spread across the floor, a galaxy of facts and figures. I looked at them
from a great height. They were the argument we would present. Necessary.
But they were the shield, not the sword. The sword was out there, in the
dark, under a mound of earth at the listening place.</p>
<p>I could not go tonight. The jungle at night was not a place; it was a
condition. A state of being consumed. And I was not ready. I needed the
tools of both worlds: Daniel’s modern precision, and the old, silent
knowing the house was teaching me.</p>
<p>Sleep was impossible. The clarity that had washed over me was a cold,
bright stream, scouring away fatigue. I spent the remaining hours before
dawn not at the desk, but sitting on the floor of the verandah, my back
against a <em>belian</em> post, watching the darkness between the trees.
I listened past the cicadas’ electric hum, past the distant cough of a
barking deer. I listened for the land’s breath. It was there, beneath
everything—a deep, subsonic rhythm, like the slow beat of a sleeping
heart. I had read my grandmother’s journals as poetry. Now I felt them
as physiology.</p>
<p>The sky paled from black to the colour of a bruise, then to a damp,
grey wool. Daniel found me there as the first birds began their
tentative questioning.</p>
<p>“You didn’t sleep,” he said, not as a greeting. He was holding two
tin mugs of bitter, strong coffee. He handed one to me. His eyes were
puffy, but alert. He had slept, but not deeply.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. The word was rough, unused.</p>
<p>He followed my gaze out into the waking jungle. “What happened?”</p>
<p>I told him. Not as a ghost story, but as a report. The sound. The
empty room. The dust-map. Its configuration. The mound.</p>
<p>He did not interrupt. He sipped his coffee, his engineer’s mind
processing the data. When I finished, he was silent for a long moment,
staring into his mug.</p>
<p>“A map in dust,” he said finally. The statement was neutral, a
calibration.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And you believe it was… a communication.”</p>
<p>“I believe it was information. Delivered. Its origin is less
important than its content.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. He had seen the house swallow rain. He had felt the
wrongness in the survey lines. His world had already cracked to admit
new axioms. This was just another data point, however anomalous. “The
listening place. You think she buried something there.”</p>
<p>“I know she did.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The heart of her work. The primary source. Not a translation, but
the thing itself.”</p>
<p>“Proof,” he said, the word solid, practical.</p>
<p>“More than proof. A counter-agent.” I looked at him. “We need to dig.
Today.”</p>
<p>He exhaled, a long, slow release. “The ground there is alluvial. Clay
and old root systems. It’ll be hard. We’ll need proper tools. The spade
from the cottage is rusted through.”</p>
<p>“Then we get proper tools.”</p>
<p>A faint, grim smile touched his lips. “The hardware store in town
opens at eight. We can be there and back by ten.” He paused. “And if
someone sees us? If Razak’s men are watching?”</p>
<p>“Let them watch,” I said, the cold clarity still holding me. “Let
them see us act like heirs. Like owners. We are not sneaking. We are
tending.”</p>
<p>The town in the hard morning light felt like a diorama of a life I
had never lived. The hardware store was a narrow cave of
smells—kerosene, new rope, sweet sawdust, the tang of galvanized metal.
We bought two good spades, a pickaxe, a heavy-duty tarp, and two pairs
of thick work gloves. The proprietor, a thin Chinese man with eyes that
missed nothing, took our money without comment. Our European clothes,
our city pallor, the specific gravity of our purpose—it all marked us as
people from the <em>rumah besar</em>. He asked no questions.</p>
<p>As we loaded the tools into Daniel’s four-wheel-drive, I saw a man
across the street, leaning against a motorbike, talking on a phone. He
did not look at us, but his posture was a form of attention. Razak’s
eye. I met Daniel’s glance. He had seen it too. We drove away, the new
tools clattering in the back, a proclamation of our intent.</p>
<p>Back at the house, the day was heating up, the air thickening like
soup. We changed into older clothes. The act felt ritualistic. Gearing
up for a different kind of work. We took water, the tools, and a length
of rope. I carried my grandmother’s journals in a satchel, their weight
a talisman.</p>
<p>The walk to the listening place was different. Before, it had been a
pilgrimage of observation. Now it was a march. The jungle seemed to
watch our passage, the usual chatter of life subdued, as if holding a
collective pause. The light that fell through the canopy was green and
heavy.</p>
<p>We reached the clearing. The stream’s murmur was the only sound. The
<em>belian</em> stump, the listening seat, sat in its pool of stillness.
I walked to the centre of the clearing, to the spot the dust-map had
indicated. The ground here was unremarkable—a mat of damp leaf litter, a
few shy ferns. There was no marker, no stone.</p>
<p>“Here,” I said, my voice too loud in the green silence.</p>
<p>Daniel drove the pickaxe into the earth. The sound was a shock—a
blunt, brutal violation of the quiet. The ground resisted, then gave
with a wet suck. We worked in shifts, Daniel breaking the tough mat of
roots and clay with the pick, me following with the spade, clearing the
spoil onto the tarp. The physical labour was a furnace. Sweat stung my
eyes, soaked my shirt, blended my scent with the smell of torn earth and
decaying leaves. There was no room for thought, only the rhythm of lift
and turn, the grate of metal on stone.</p>
<p>We hit a root network, ancient and thick as cables. Daniel attacked
it with the pickaxe, the blows jarring up his arms. The sound was like
bones breaking. Finally, with a fibrous crack, it yielded. We were two
feet down. Then three.</p>
<p>The world narrowed to the hole. To the burn in my shoulders, the
blister forming on my palm. The house, Razak, the trust, London—all of
it receded, ghosts from a distant shore. There was only the earth, and
what it might yield.</p>
<p>My spade struck something that was not root, not stone. A different
sound. A hollow <em>thunk</em> of resistance.</p>
<p>We both froze. Daniel dropped the pickaxe. I knelt in the dirt,
scraping with my gloved hands. The soil was cooler here, darker. My
fingers found an edge. Straight, manufactured. I cleared more earth. It
was a box. About two feet long, one foot wide, made of the same
iron-hard <em>belian</em> wood as the house, banded with tarnished
brass.</p>
<p>My breath caught. The cold clarity from the night before returned,
sharp as a needle.</p>
<p>Together, we cleared the rest of the soil from its lid. There was no
lock, only a simple brass clasp, green with verdigris. I looked at
Daniel. His face was streaked with dirt and sweat, his eyes wide. He
gave a single, sharp nod.</p>
<p>I reached down, my heart a hammer against my ribs. I released the
clasp. It opened with a reluctant, metallic shriek.</p>
<p>The lid was heavy. I lifted it.</p>
<p>Inside, nestled in a bed of what looked like dried moss and crumbling
black silk, were not journals. Not papers.</p>
<p>It was a collection of objects.</p>
<p>On top lay a <em>kris</em>. Its sheath was plain, aged wood, but the
hilt was carved <em>belian</em>, shaped into the form of a coiled,
sightless serpent. Its <em>ganja</em>, the base of the blade, was just
visible—a hint of dark, pamor-forged metal, the swirling patterns in the
steel like frozen smoke.</p>
<p>Beside it was a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. I lifted it, the cloth
brittle in my fingers. It fell away to reveal a smooth, river-worn
stone, dark grey and shot through with a single, jagged vein of quartz
that pulsed white in the dappled light. It fit perfectly in my palm,
cold and impossibly dense.</p>
<p>Beneath these, carefully arranged, were perhaps two dozen small,
cylindrical scrolls. Not paper. They were strips of dried, treated palm
leaf, <em>lontar</em>, each tied with a thin strip of black cord. The
script on them was not my grandmother’s flowing hand. It was older,
spikier, an archaic form of Jawi.</p>
<p>And at the very bottom, resting on the silk, was a single, sealed
envelope. My name was on it. <em>Ameena</em>. Written in my
grandmother’s unmistakable ink.</p>
<p>The world did not stop. The stream still murmured. A bird called
somewhere. But I felt a tectonic shift, deep in the substructure of
things. This was not a cache of research. This was a reliquary. A
toolbox for a different kind of repair.</p>
<p>I picked up the envelope. My hands were trembling. I broke the seal,
a simple wax blob with no impression.</p>
<p>Inside was a single sheet of her heavy, cream paper.</p>
<p><em>My dearest Ameena,</em></p>
<p><em>If you are reading this, you have found the map I left in the
dust. You have listened past the words to the silence that holds them.
You are ready, or you would not be here.</em></p>
<p><em>The man, Razak, is not your enemy. He is a tool of the imbalance.
The land where he wants to build is sick. It has been sick since long
before you were born. Since the last keeper failed.</em></p>
<p><em>What I buried here is not proof for a court. It is medicine for
the land. The </em>kris* is not a weapon. It is a key. The stone is not
a rock. It is a memory. The <em>lontar</em> scrolls are not histories.
They are prescriptions.*</p>
<p><em>The boundary he wishes to cut follows an old wound. A rupture
made not by men with bulldozers, but by a forgetting. A keeper who broke
the covenant. The land’s breath there is shallow, fevered. It draws the
wrong kind of attention—the greedy, the short-sighted, the hollow men
like Razak. It is a weakness, and it will be exploited until it is
healed.</em></p>
<p><em>To heal it, you must perform the </em>Sumpah Tanah<em>. The Earth
Vow. It was the vow of the keepers of this place, long before our
family, long before this house. It has not been performed in three
generations. The ritual is described in the </em>lontar<em>. The
</em>kris* and the stone are its instruments.*</p>
<p><em>It is not a ceremony of ownership. It is a ceremony of belonging.
A re-stitching of the tear.</em></p>
<p><em>I could not do it. The break occurred in my grandfather’s time.
The knowledge was already fading. I spent my life mapping the symptoms,
diagnosing the illness. I gathered these pieces. But the vow requires a
keeper who is both of the old blood and of the new world. One who can
see the wound with clear eyes, and who has the will to act. It requires
you.</em></p>
<p><em>The law will not save this place. Only the vow can.</em></p>
<p><em>Do not be afraid. The house has chosen you. The land knows your
step.</em></p>
<p><em>With all my love, and all my hope,</em> <em>Nenek</em></p>
<p>I read it twice. The words did not so much sink in as bypass my mind
and settle directly into my bones. The scale of it was monstrous. A
ritual. A vow. Not a legal defence, but a spiritual surgery.</p>
<p>I handed the letter to Daniel. He read it, his lips moving slightly.
When he finished, he looked from the letter to the open box, his face a
mask of stunned comprehension.</p>
<p>“A ritual,” he said, the word flat.</p>
<p>“A repair,” I corrected, my voice quiet but steady.</p>
<p>“Ameena… this is… this is not what we do. This is not science. This
is…”</p>
<p>“What?” I asked, looking at him. “What is it? You felt the anomaly in
your readings. You know the data is wrong along that line. You called it
a suture through living tissue. This is the suture.”</p>
<p>“But a <em>kris</em>? A vow? These are… symbols. Metaphors.”</p>
<p>I picked up the stone. It was not cold anymore. It held a warmth, as
if it had absorbed the heat of my hand instantly and was now radiating
it back. The quartz vein seemed to gleam from within. “Is it a metaphor,
Daniel? Or is it a technology we’ve forgotten how to measure?”</p>
<p>He had no answer. He stared at the stone in my hand as if it were a
coiled snake.</p>
<p>“She says Razak is not the enemy. The land’s sickness draws him. Like
flies to a wound.” The pieces were aligning with a terrible, beautiful
logic. “We can fight him in court. We might even win a delay. But if the
wound remains, another Razak will come. And another. Until the land is
bled dry. She’s not asking me to save the house from a developer. She’s
asking me to heal the land so the developer no longer has a reason to be
here.”</p>
<p>“And you believe that’s possible.” It was not a question.</p>
<p>I looked at the <em>kris</em>, the scrolls, the stone. I thought of
the dust that formed a map, of the rain the house drank, of the breath
beneath the world. “I believe this is the only thing that is possible.
Everything else is… paperwork on the deck of a sinking ship.”</p>
<p>The silence stretched between us, filled with the stream’s whisper
and the weight of a choice that was no choice at all.</p>
<p>“What do the scrolls say?” he finally asked, his voice resigned. The
engineer yielding to the evidence.</p>
<p>I carefully untied one of the <em>lontar</em> cylinders. The palm
leaf was brittle, the script brown and faded. My Jawi was good, but this
was archaic, laced with Sanskrit and old Malay terms for which I had no
translation. It was a list. Ingredients. Actions. Phrases.</p>
<p>“It’s instructions,” I said, my heart sinking. “But it’s not
complete. It references things… places, plants, states of being. It
assumes knowledge I don’t have.” I looked at the others. Each would be a
piece of the whole. A puzzle in a dead language.</p>
<p>“Then we translate them,” Daniel said. He said ‘we’. The word was a
anchor. “All of them. We use everything. Your knowledge, my logic. We
treat it like a technical manual. For a machine we don’t yet
understand.”</p>
<p>He was right. The despair that threatened to rise was met by a new,
gritty determination. This was my grandmother’s life’s work, distilled
into this box. It was another archive. The most vital one. It just
required a different kind of reading.</p>
<p>We carefully repacked the box, leaving out only one scroll and the
letter. We refilled the hole, tamping the earth back down, spreading the
leaf litter over the scar. The clearing looked untouched. But everything
had changed.</p>
<p>Carrying the box between us, we walked back to the house. It felt
heavier than its physical weight. It was the weight of a lineage, of a
debt, of a task that stretched back into a past I could scarcely
imagine.</p>
<p>We hid the box in the most obvious place—under my grandmother’s bed
in the main house. A place of childhood secrecy, now a vault.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, we worked in a feverish, silent tandem.
Daniel set up a photography rig, carefully shooting each <em>lontar</em>
scroll under controlled light. I began the painstaking work of
transcribing the Jawi into my notebook, then attempting a translation,
circling the unknown terms. The ritual—the <em>Sumpah Tanah</em>—was not
a single event. It was a process. A preparation of the self, a gathering
of elements from specific points along the <em>jalan ingatan</em>, a
sequence of words and silences to be performed at a specific time. The
next new moon. Five days away.</p>
<p>One scroll detailed the “purification of the vessel”—the keeper. It
involved bathing in water gathered from seven sources on the land at
dawn. Another listed the “offerings of memory”: specific resins to be
burned, seeds to be planted, threads to be tied. The <em>kris</em> was
to be “awakened” with water and smoke. The stone was to be “charged” at
the listening place under the full moon—which had just passed. We had
missed a step.</p>
<p>The final scroll, the most damaged, described the vow itself. It was
to be spoken at the site of the wound—the very boundary line Razak
sought to claim. The words were a mixture of plea, promise, and
declaration. They spoke of remembering what had been forgotten, of
taking the sickness of the place into oneself, and offering wholeness in
return. It spoke of a price.</p>
<p><em>The keeper stands in the breach,</em> it read. <em>The keeper
becomes the bridge. What is taken must be received. What is received
leaves a mark. The land’s memory becomes the keeper’s memory. The
keeper’s breath becomes the land’s breath. This is the exchange. This is
the vow.</em></p>
<p>A chill that had nothing to do with the evening air crept down my
spine. It was not a metaphor. It was a transaction. An integration. What
would it mean, for the land’s memory to become mine? What memories did
this wounded earth hold?</p>
<p>As dusk stained the sky, we hit a wall. A key term, repeated
throughout the final scroll: <em>Penunggu Yang Tercerai</em>. The
Separated Guardian.</p>
<p>“It’s not a what,” Daniel said, peering at my notes. “It’s a who. A
guardian who was separated. From what?”</p>
<p>“From the land,” I murmured, the answer forming as I said it. “The
break. The forgotten covenant. It was a person. A keeper who… left? Who
broke the vow?” I thought of the line in my grandmother’s letter.
<em>Since the last keeper failed.</em></p>
<p>“So this ritual… it’s not just healing the land. It’s… reconnecting a
severed guardian?” Daniel’s brow was furrowed. “How do you reconnect a
person who’s been gone for generations?”</p>
<p>“You don’t,” I said, the realization dawning with a slow, dreadful
horror. “You replace them.”</p>
<p>The words hung in the air. <em>The keeper stands in the breach. The
keeper becomes the bridge.</em></p>
<p>I was not just performing a repair. I was applying for a position. A
permanent one.</p>
<p>The hook of the task, which had seemed merely impossible, now
revealed its true barb. It was not asking for a week of my life. It was
asking for all of it.</p>
<p>The sound of an engine, rough and out of place, cut through the
twilight. It came from the front of the property. Not Daniel’s car. A
heavier vehicle.</p>
<p>We looked at each other. The translation was forgotten.</p>
<p>We walked to the front verandah. A dark, polished SUV was parked in
the gravel turnaround, dust settling around it. The driver’s door
opened, and a man in a crisp, short-sleeved shirt and tailored trousers
stepped out. He was not Razak. He was older, with a calm, authoritative
face and eyes that took in the house, the grounds, and finally us, with
a single, sweeping assessment.</p>
<p>He walked towards the steps, not waiting for an invitation. He
stopped at the bottom, looking up at us.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” he said. His voice was cultured, smooth. “Miss Ameena
Zainal? My name is Harun. I am from the State Heritage Trust. I believe
we have an appointment for tomorrow morning to discuss the interim
findings?”</p>
<p>He was a day early. His smile was polite, professional, and utterly
devoid of warmth. His gaze lingered on my dirt-stained clothes, on
Daniel’s weary face, on the open door of the house behind us.</p>
<p>“I was in the area,” he continued, his tone implying a universe of
unspoken reasons. “I thought, given the… sensitivities… of this case, it
might be prudent to begin our discussions a little earlier. To ensure we
are all on the same page before the formal meeting.”</p>
<p>He mounted the first step. His shoes were expensive, and very
clean.</p>
<p>“May I come in?”</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-17-1">CHAPTER 17</h2>
<p>Harun did not wait for an answer. His question was a formality, a
bead of civility strung on a wire of intent. He mounted the remaining
steps, his polished shoes whispering against the worn <em>belian</em>
planks of the verandah. He moved like a man accustomed to crossing
thresholds without permission, his authority a subtle, scentless thing
in the air, like the ozone before a different kind of storm.</p>
<p>“The house is not ready for visitors,” I said. My voice was too dry,
the words cracking at the edges.</p>
<p>“I am not a visitor, Miss Zainal. I am the liaison.” His smile
remained, a fixed, pleasant arrangement of features. His eyes, however,
were inventorying the verandah—the pile of rotted sacking we had dragged
from the <em>anjung</em>, the water-stained ledgers Daniel had left
splayed open on the rattan settee, the two empty glasses smelling of
stale tea and fear. “And it appears you have been quite busy. I
understood the trust’s instructions were for a preliminary assessment
only. A surface evaluation.”</p>
<p>Daniel shifted his weight. “We’ve been evaluating.”</p>
<p>Harun’s gaze settled on him. “Mr. Teoh. The conservationist from
Singapore. Your involvement was noted.” The way he said ‘noted’ made it
sound like a symptom. “I trust your professional opinion is
forming?”</p>
<p>“It’s forming,” Daniel said, his tone carefully neutral.</p>
<p>“Good. Then we shall form ours together.” Harun stepped past us,
through the open front doors into the gloom of the main hall. He did not
startle at the shift in temperature, the breath of cool, still air that
always lived in the <em>rumah besar</em>’s throat. He stood in the
centre of the space, hands clasped loosely behind his back, a curator in
a gallery of shadows. His eyes travelled up the soaring columns, over
the intricate <em>pengkang</em> joints, across the lattice of the
<em>pintu pagar</em>. He did not see the beauty. He was performing an
audit.</p>
<p>“The structural report from our engineers is preliminary, but
concerning,” he began, his voice echoing softly in the vault.
“Significant dry rot in the north-east <em>tiang seri</em>. Subsidence
in the <em>parang</em> sill beam. The roof, as you know, is a patchwork
over a wound. The cost of a full, faithful restoration…” He let the
sentence dissolve, a sugar-cube in bitter coffee. “It is prohibitive.
Historically significant, yes. But not unique. There are other <em>rumah
tiang dua belas</em> in the state. Better preserved.”</p>
<p>I felt the words like a physical pressure on my sternum. “This is my
grandmother’s house.”</p>
<p>“It is a piece of state heritage,” he corrected gently. “Your
grandmother was its last private steward. A role that, by all accounts,
ended… ambiguously.” He turned to face me fully. “The trust’s mandate is
preservation. But preservation must be balanced with pragmatism. With
the needs of the living.”</p>
<p>“What are you proposing?” Daniel asked. He had moved to stand beside
the central pillar, a hand resting lightly on the wood, as if steadying
it.</p>
<p>“A compromise. The facade, the main hall, one
<em>anjung</em>—stabilised, restored as a museum exhibit. A shell. The
rest…” He made a small, dismissive motion with his fingers. “The
ancillary structures are too far gone. The land, of course, has value. A
developer has expressed interest in a sensitive, low-density project
that would incorporate the preserved core. It would secure the house’s
future. In a form.”</p>
<p>The house was silent around us. But it was a listening silence. The
dust motes hung in the slats of late light, suspended in judgement.</p>
<p>“A form,” I repeated. The hook of the task, the one I had felt sink
into my own flesh, twisted. They wanted to cut away the diseased parts,
the inconvenient memories, the dark, pulsing heart of it, and keep the
handsome bones in a glass case. They would peel the skin from the
<em>rumah besar</em> and call it salvation.</p>
<p>“It is the most realistic outcome,” Harun said. He took a slim tablet
from his leather folio, waking the screen. A blueprint glowed there,
sterile and angular. Overlaid on the sketch of the land was a new
geometry: neat, shaded boxes where the old kitchen stood, where the
servants’ quarters huddled, where the overgrown family cemetery slept.
“The proposal has support at several levels. It resolves the question of
the house, and it brings investment, modern infrastructure. A win for
history, and for progress.”</p>
<p>“You’re here a day early to pressure her into agreeing before the
formal meeting,” Daniel said. It wasn’t an accusation; it was a
translation.</p>
<p>Harun’s smile didn’t falter. “I am here to manage expectations. To
prevent the attachment of… sentimental hope… to a non-viable outcome.
Your grandmother, Miss Zainal, left things in a state of some disarray.
The legalities are complex. The trust is offering a clean, honourable
solution. A way for you to fulfil your duty without shouldering an
impossible burden.”</p>
<p><em>Duty</em>. The word was a polished stone, smooth and cold. He was
offering me a different kind of bridge—a short, clean span from this
entanglement back to my life in London. All I had to do was consent to
the amputation.</p>
<p>“I need to see the full engineering report,” I said. “And the
conservation methodology for the ‘preserved core’.”</p>
<p>A flicker in his eyes, there and gone. A slight reassessment. He had
expected grief, perhaps. Or avarice. Not this flat, professional demand.
“Of course. It will be available tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“And I need the night to consider.”</p>
<p>“Naturally.” He inclined his head. “But time, unfortunately, is not a
neutral party. The monsoon will advance. The decay does not pause for
deliberation. Every day of indecision has a cost.” He slid the tablet
back into his folio. “I will return at ten a.m. We can discuss your
thoughts then, before the full committee convenes.”</p>
<p>He gave the hall one last, sweeping look. His gaze passed over the
darkened doorway to the inner passage, the one that led to the ruined
<em>bilik</em> and the staircase that descended. It did not linger. To
him, it was just another shadow.</p>
<p>“Good evening to you both. Try to get some rest. This process can be…
draining.”</p>
<p>He left as he came, without ceremony. The sound of his SUV engine was
a low, receding growl, swallowed by the green twilight. The dust he had
stirred settled back onto the gravel.</p>
<p>Daniel let out a long, controlled breath. “They’re going to gut
it.”</p>
<p>“They’re going to kill it,” I said. The difference was everything. A
gutted house could be a museum. A killed house was just a corpse. The
<em>thing</em> that lived here, the slow, patient intelligence in the
wood and the memory in the plaster, would be gone. Evicted. Or
worse.</p>
<p>“He didn’t ask about the translation. About the <em>jaga</em>.”
Daniel’s voice was low. “He didn’t look at the books.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t care. That’s not part of his audit. It’s folklore.
Sentiment.” I walked to the front doors and pushed them shut. The solid
<em>thunk</em> was a feeble barricade. “He cares about dry rot and
development value.”</p>
<p>“So what do we do?”</p>
<p><em>We</em>. The word hung between us, a fragile bridge of its own. I
looked at him—his tired eyes, the smudge of old mortar on his collar,
the way his shoulders were set not in defeat, but in a kind of weary
readiness. He had seen the hook, too. He knew what it demanded. And he
was still here.</p>
<p>“We finish the translation,” I said. “We find out exactly what the
position entails. Before I accept it. Or before I tell Harun to take his
compromise and burn it.”</p>
<hr />
<p>We worked in the <em>anjung</em>, under the yellow pool of light from
the storm lantern. The night was a close, velvet press outside the
windows. The ledger lay between us, its pages whispering of another kind
of time.</p>
<p>The final section was not a list. It was a contract.</p>
<p>The language shifted from the meticulous record-keeping of the
earlier pages into a more formal, almost ritualistic prose. It was
written in my grandmother’s hand, but the words were not hers. They were
a transcription, passed down.</p>
<p><em>…and so the House, being wounded in its spirit by the
Unforgotten, requires a Keeper. Not of brick and beam, but of the
Breach. The Keeper shall stand in the gap where memory has torn. The
Keeper shall become the Bridge, the Tie-Beam that binds the Then to the
Now.</em></p>
<p><em>The Selection is thus: the House shall call a child of its blood
in whom the old pathways are not entirely closed. One who sees the rain
eaten, and hears the sigh in the wood. One who dreams the dreams of the
foundation stone.</em></p>
<p>My skin prickled. <em>One who sees the rain eaten.</em> My first
thought, on that first day. The house’s digestion of the storm.</p>
<p><em>The Acceptance is thus: the Keeper must willingly perform the
Three Bindings. The Binding of the Name, spoken to the central pillar at
the dead of night. The Binding of the Object, a thing of profound
personal memory placed within the heart-wall. The Binding of the Self, a
voluntary tethering of the life’s breath to the house’s rhythm.</em></p>
<p><em>Upon completion, the Breach shall be sealed. The Unforgotten
shall be comforted, their rage gentled into remembrance. The House shall
be whole. The Keeper shall be its guardian, and it shall be the Keeper’s
world. The boundary shall soften. The past shall not be a foreign
country, but a room adjacent.</em></p>
<p><em>Warning is given: the Binding is irrevocable. To sever it is to
re-open the Breach, with consequences most grave. The Keeper’s life and
the House’s spirit become as warp and weft. One cannot unravel without
destroying the other.</em></p>
<p>Daniel read the last lines aloud, his voice hushed. “<em>‘The Keeper
shall not age as those outside age. Their time shall become the House’s
time, which is slow, and deep, and measured in the settling of beams and
the growth of moss.’</em>” He looked up, his face pale in the lantern
light. “Ameena. This isn’t a job. It’s a life sentence. It’s…
immortality of a kind. Trapped here.”</p>
<p><em>The Keeper stands in the breach. The keeper becomes the
bridge.</em> The hook was not just barbed. It was a gilded cage.</p>
<p>“It explains Nenek,” I said, the pieces clicking into a terrible,
coherent picture. “She wasn’t just a recluse. She was <em>Bound</em>.
Her life was this house’s life. She was maintaining the seal.” I thought
of her letters, the way time seemed to blur in them, years passing in a
sentence. She wasn’t describing monotony. She was describing a different
scale of existence.</p>
<p>“And when she died… the seal broke. The ‘Unforgotten’ got out. The
disturbances started.” Daniel ran a hand through his hair. “So Razak,
the trust… they’re not just dealing with a decaying building. They’re
poking at a psychic wound they don’t believe in. And their ‘solution’
would be like performing surgery with a bulldozer.”</p>
<p>“It would unleash whatever is in that Breach completely,” I
whispered. The cool air of the hall felt suddenly malevolent, a held
breath waiting to be released. “Harun talks about dry rot. This is about
a rot in the memory of the place. A trauma that never healed.”</p>
<p>“And you’re the only one who can re-heal it.” Daniel stated it
flatly. “According to this… you’ve already been Selected. The ‘child of
its blood’. The one who hears and sees. All that’s left is the
Acceptance.”</p>
<p>The Three Bindings. A name. An object. A self.</p>
<p>I thought of my name, spoken to the central pillar in the dark. I
thought of an object of profound memory. The locket? My mother’s
sketchbook? I thought of tethering my life’s breath to the sigh of the
wood, to the digestion of the rain. To become part of the house’s slow,
deep time. To watch from the windows as the world outside sped by, as
Daniel grew old, as cities rose and fell, while I remained, a fixture, a
living part of the architecture.</p>
<p>The horror of it was absolute. And yet, beneath the terror, a
treacherous, whispering thread of understanding. Was this not what I had
always done? In my work, I tethered myself to the past, to silent stones
and abandoned places. I had always felt like a visitor in my own
present. The house was offering me a home, not in space, but in time. A
permanent residency in the Then.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” I said, but the words were ash.</p>
<p>“You must,” said a new voice, thin and cracked as old parchment.</p>
<p>We both started. The <em>anjung</em> had only one entrance, from the
main hall. No one was there.</p>
<p>The voice came again, from the corner where the shadows were
thickest, pooled like ink. “You are the thread. The only thread
left.”</p>
<p>An old woman stepped into the edge of the lantern light. She was
tiny, bent double, her spine a question mark. Her skin was a map of deep
wrinkles, her hair a wispy grey cloud. She wore a faded <em>kebaya</em>
and a sarong that had once been bright. But it was her eyes that held
me—milky with cataracts, yet seeing everything.</p>
<p>“Makcik Intan,” I breathed. The name surfaced from a childhood story,
a ghost from Nenek’s past. Her older sister. The one who had stayed when
Nenek left for the city. The one who was said to have died decades
ago.</p>
<p>A slow, toothless smile stretched her lips. “She remembered me in
stories. Good. The stories are the glue.”</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to be dead,” Daniel said, his voice tight with
shock.</p>
<p>“I am dead to them. To the world outside the fence.” She shuffled
forward, leaning on a gnarled <em>belian</em> stick. “I am the Relief
Keeper. Appointed when your Nenek answered the call. My task was to tend
the edges, to watch the perimeter, so she could tend the heart. When she
passed, the full weight fell to me. But I am not of the direct blood. I
can only hold the line. I cannot mend the Breach.” She fixed her cloudy
gaze on me. “It has been… hard. The Unforgotten push at the walls I
make. They are angry. So angry.”</p>
<p>“Who are they?” I asked. “The Unforgotten?”</p>
<p>Her face crumpled further, a landscape of grief. “The ones who were
not allowed to be remembered. The sacrifice that built the peace. When
the old chief built this house, there was a war. A bitter feud with the
people of the next river. To secure the land, to make the foundation
strong, a bargain was struck. Not with men. With older things. A life
was given. Not one. Three. His youngest son. His favourite wife. The
<em>bomoh</em> who consecrated the act. Their names were struck from the
family history. Their memories were folded into the foundation stone,
buried. They were to be the hidden guardians, the price paid. But a
price forgotten is a debt that screams.”</p>
<p>The air grew colder. The lantern flame guttered.</p>
<p>“They are not guardians,” Intan whispered. “They are prisoners. And
my sister, your Nenek, she was their warden. She soothed them with her
presence, her own life bound to the house. She gave them a focus for
their rage that was not the living world. Now she is gone. I am too
weak. And the men in clean shoes come to break the walls down. If they
do, the Unforgotten will flood out. Their rage has festered for
generations. It will not be kind.”</p>
<p>The full, grotesque shape of it was now clear. The house wasn’t
haunted by ghosts. It was a prison for three tortured souls, a dam
holding back a reservoir of bitter, forgotten violence. My grandmother
had been the dam’s engineer. And I was the inheritor of the
blueprints.</p>
<p>“The Three Bindings,” I said. “They’re not just a ritual. They’re the
tools to rebuild the dam.”</p>
<p>Intan nodded, a slow, painful dip of her head. “The Name Binding
re-establishes the lineage, the authority of the blood. The Object
Binding gives them a new memory to hold, a kinder one, to replace the
memory of betrayal. The Self Binding… that is the cement. Your life
becomes the new lock on their cage. A kinder cage, but a cage
still.”</p>
<p>“So I would be perpetuating it,” I said, a hollow opening inside me.
“I would be taking over the imprisonment.”</p>
<p>“You would be transforming it,” Intan insisted, her knuckles white on
her stick. “From a prison of forgetting to a… a sanctuary of
acknowledgement. You would be with them. You would remember them. That
is what they truly crave. To be known. To have their sacrifice mean
something. The alternative is their release. And they are not…
themselves anymore. Only the rage is left.”</p>
<p>Daniel had been silent, absorbing the nightmare. Now he spoke. “There
has to be another way. A way to release them properly. To help them…
move on.”</p>
<p>Intan turned her blind gaze toward him. “The way to release them was
destroyed when their names were erased. The bridge to the other side was
burned. The house <em>is</em> their afterlife. The only peace possible
for them is a peaceful house. A remembered house.” She looked back at
me. “You have until the men with machines come. The one who was here
today, his mind is made of numbers. He will not listen. He will bring
the machines. They will start with the outbuildings. The noise, the
violence… it will be like beating on the bars of a cell. The Unforgotten
will break free.”</p>
<p>She began to shuffle back toward the shadows. “I must return to the
perimeter. The whispers are loud tonight. They smell your indecision. It
makes them hungry.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” I said. “Where do I go? What do I do?”</p>
<p>She paused, a silhouette against the darker black. “The heart-wall is
behind the central pillar. The stone is there. You will know the object
to give. And you will know if you can give yourself. There is no guide
for that. Only the knowing.”</p>
<p>Then she was gone, melting into the darkness of the hall as if she
were made of the same stuff.</p>
<p>Daniel and I were left in the trembling circle of light. The ledger’s
pages seemed to leer at us.</p>
<p>“This is insane,” he said, but the conviction was gone from his
voice. It had been replaced by a grim acceptance. The world had peeled
back, and this was the wet, pulsing reality beneath.</p>
<p>“It’s the only insanity on offer,” I replied. I felt a strange calm
descending, the calm that comes when all choices are terrible, and the
only path forward is into the dark. “I can run. I can let Harun have it.
And whatever happens after that… happens. Or I can stay. I can try to
bind myself to this… this eternal, impossible task.”</p>
<p>“You’ll disappear,” he said, and the raw pain in his voice was a new
kind of hook. “You’ll become part of the furniture. I’ll come back in a
year, and you’ll be a story the locals tell. The madwoman in the old
house who never ages.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.” I looked at my hands, imagining them smoothing the same
banister for a hundred years, watching the moss creep up the same step.
“Or maybe I’ll be the only thing standing between that story and a real,
spreading horror.” I stood up, my legs steady. “I need to see the
stone.”</p>
<hr />
<p>The central pillar, the <em>tiang seri</em>, was the soul of the
house. All weight, all balance, flowed through it. In the darkness of
the main hall, it was a profound blackness, a vertical slice of
night.</p>
<p>I knelt before it. Daniel stood back, a silent witness.</p>
<p>“The heart-wall,” Intan had said. I placed my palms on the cool,
seamless wood. I pressed. Nothing. I moved my hands lower, to the base
where the pillar met the raised floor of the <em>serambi</em>. My
fingers found a slight irregularity, a hairline seam in the iron-hard
wood. A panel, perfectly fitted.</p>
<p>I had no tool. I dug my fingernails in, a futile gesture. As I did, a
sliver of wood pierced my thumb. A bead of blood welled, black in the
gloom. I smeared it against the seam.</p>
<p>With a soft, sighing click, the panel slid inward an inch. A small,
dark cavity was revealed.</p>
<p>Inside was the foundation stone. It was not large, perhaps the size
of a loaf of bread, a rough, river-smoothed piece of granite. It was
unadorned. But laid upon it were three objects.</p>
<p>A small, tarnished silver bracelet, child-sized. A broken hairpin of
tortoiseshell. A single, weathered cowrie shell.</p>
<p>The objects of the previous Keepers. Their Binding gifts. Things of
profound memory, given to the forgotten, to hold in their endless
dark.</p>
<p>I reached in. My fingers brushed the cold stone. And the world
dissolved.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>I am not myself.</em></p>
<p><em>I am three. I am a boy, laughing, running through tall grass, the
silver bracelet on my wrist chiming. A hand reaches for me—my
father’s?—but it is not a caress. It is a grip of iron. The laughter
dies in my throat. The world turns to dark earth, pressing, suffocating.
The taste of soil. The cold, eternal weight. My name… I had a
name…</em></p>
<p><em>I am a woman, humming, plaiting my hair with the tortoiseshell
pin. The scent of frangipani. A promise whispered in my ear. Then a
betrayal, sharp and sudden. The pin snaps. The darkness is not peaceful.
It is a fury. I weave my rage into the very grain of the floors above
me. Let them feel my displeasure in every creak, every groan.</em></p>
<p><em>I am an old man, chanting, the cowrie shell my focus. I call on
the old powers to bless this house, to make it strong. I did not know
the price would be paid in flesh. My flesh. Their flesh. My magic
becomes our tomb. The shell is no longer a tool, but a prison. My regret
is a vine that strangles the foundation.</em></p>
<p><em>Three lives. Three murders. Folded into stone. Forgotten by
decree.</em></p>
<p><em>The pain is not a memory. It is a current. It is now. It is
forever.</em></p>
<p><em>And now, a new presence. A light. A thread of blood and
intention.</em></p>
<p><em>She sees us.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I recoiled, gasping, tearing my hand from the cavity. I fell back
onto the floor, my breath coming in ragged sobs. Daniel was beside me in
an instant, his hands on my shoulders.</p>
<p>“Ameena! What happened?”</p>
<p>I could only shake my head, the visions seared onto the back of my
eyes. The boy’ terror. The woman’s bitter wrath. The old man’s
bottomless regret. They were not monsters. They were victims. And their
eternal, churning anguish was the engine of the house’s sickness.</p>
<p>“I saw them,” I choked out. “I felt them.”</p>
<p>The understanding was a physical sickness. Harun’s ‘dry rot’ was the
manifestation of their buried rage. The ‘subsidence’ was their struggle
against the stone. The house was not decaying. It was being tortured
from within.</p>
<p>And the proposed ‘compromise’—the demolition, the drilling, the
violence of construction—would be the final, unbearable agony. It would
not just release them. It would shatter them, and their shattered pieces
would scatter like psychic shrapnel.</p>
<p>I knew then, with a certainty that settled in my bones like a cold,
heavy sediment.</p>
<p>I could not run.</p>
<p>The Binding was not an acceptance of a duty. It was a triage. The
only way to prevent a catastrophe was to step into the wound and try to
stitch it closed around me.</p>
<p>I looked at Daniel, his face etched with fear and care. I thought of
my flat in London, of my career, of the future that was a clean,
straight line. All of it seemed like a dream I’d had once, a story about
someone else.</p>
<p>“I have to do it,” I said, my voice quiet now, final. “Tonight.
Before Harun returns. Before they start.”</p>
<p>“Ameena, no—”</p>
<p>“There is no ‘no’,” I interrupted. “There is only this, or the chaos
that comes after. I can’t… I can’t let them be destroyed like that. And
I can’t let whatever they would become loose on the world.” I stood up,
wiping my soil-stained hands on my trousers. “I need you to go.”</p>
<p>He stared at me as if I’d struck him. “Go?”</p>
<p>“When it’s done… I don’t know what happens. If Intan is right, the
boundary softens. This place won’t be… safe. For someone who isn’t
Bound.” I forced the words out. “You have to be away from here by
morning.”</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving you to do this alone.”</p>
<p>“You have to.” I reached out, touching his arm, a fleeting contact.
“You’re the only one who knows the truth. If this goes wrong… someone
has to know what happened here. Not the trust’s version. The real
version.”</p>
<p>He argued. He pleaded. But he saw the resolution in my face, the
terrible, quiet clarity. He was a man who understood structures, forces,
loads. He could see the unbearable load that had been placed on this
one, fragile point. Me.</p>
<p>In the end, he simply pulled me into a fierce, brief embrace. It felt
like a goodbye from the world of the living. “Tell me what to do,” he
whispered into my hair.</p>
<p>“Take the ledger. Keep it safe. And… in a year. Come back. See if the
fence gate will still open for you.”</p>
<p>He released me, his eyes bright. He did not cry. He gathered the
ledger, his own notes, his bag. He moved like a man in a dream. At the
front verandah, he turned.</p>
<p>“The object,” he said. “What will you use?”</p>
<p>I already knew. I had known since my fingers touched the stone. It
was not the locket, or the sketchbook. It was the thing that held the
memory of my own moment of profound, life-altering loss. The thing that
had brought me here.</p>
<p>I pulled the key from my pocket. The cold, heavy key from the
solicitor’s envelope. The key that had bitten my palm on that first
rainy afternoon. The key to a door I had been too afraid to open. It was
an object of duty, of summons, of a legacy that was both gift and curse.
It was the first stitch in this binding.</p>
<p>“This,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded, a last, grim acknowledgement. Then he walked down the
steps, across the gravel, to his car. He did not look back. The engine
started, a lonely sound in the vast, listening night. The red taillights
vanished into the tunnel of trees.</p>
<p>I was alone.</p>
<p>The house drew a long, silent breath around me.</p>
<p>I had until dawn.</p>
<p>I climbed the stairs to my grandmother’s room. I would need the
quiet, the epicentre of her long keeping. I lit the old kerosene lamp on
her desk. The rain began again outside, a soft, steady pattering on the
leaves. The house started to eat it, that deep, familiar sigh resonating
through the bones of the place.</p>
<p>I sat on the edge of her bed, the cold key in my hand. I thought of
the Three Bindings.</p>
<p>The Name. The Object. The Self.</p>
<p>I knew my name. I had the object.</p>
<p>But the Self? How do you voluntarily tether your life’s breath? Is it
a wish? A vow? A surrender?</p>
<p>I would have to find out. In the dead of night, I would go to the
pillar. I would speak. I would give. And I would offer.</p>
<p>The hook was no longer in my flesh. I was swimming towards it,
opening my mouth to take it inside.</p>
<p>The lamp flame danced, casting huge, restless shadows on the walls.
They seemed to move with a purpose of their own, converging towards the
doorway, as if forming an audience. Or a procession.</p>
<p>From deep below, in the foundation, I felt a shift. A focusing. A
terrible, hungry attention.</p>
<p>They knew the candidate was ready.</p>
<p>The interview was about to begin.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-18-1">CHAPTER 18</h2>
<p>The shadows did not walk. They poured.</p>
<p>They streamed from the corners of my grandmother’s room, liquid and
silent, drawn to the flame of the lamp as if it were a siphon. They were
not the absence of light, but a substance. They had weight. They pooled
on the floorboards, thick as ink, then rose in tendrils that braided
themselves into the rough shapes of shoulders, of bowed heads, of hands
clasped in postures of waiting. An audience of smoke and old night.</p>
<p>I did not move. The key was a brand in my clenched fist.</p>
<p>This was the interview. Not a conversation. An assessment. A
tasting.</p>
<p>The deepest shadow, the one that had gathered before the closed door,
resolved. It was a woman. I knew her shape. The slope of the neck, the
set of the jaw, the way one hand rested lightly against the thigh. It
was the silhouette from the locket sketch, from a hundred faded
photographs. It was my grandmother, Zahra, as a young woman.</p>
<p>But it was a shell. A negative. A cut-out of the world where she had
once been.</p>
<p>It spoke. The voice was not a sound, but the memory of a sound,
pressed directly into the meat of my mind. It was the sigh of the house
eating the rain, given grammar.</p>
<p><em>You have the key.</em></p>
<p>It was not a question. It was a confirmation, flat and cold.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>You know the bindings.</em></p>
<p>“I know of them.”</p>
<p><em>The Name binds the flesh to the stone. The Object binds the
intention to the history. The Self binds the breath to the bargain.</em>
The shadow-Zahra tilted its head. <em>You have a name. You have an
object. What is your Self?</em></p>
<p>I had rehearsed answers in the long, tense hours since Daniel left.
<em>My Self is my will. My Self is my memory. My Self is my love for
this place.</em> They were true things. They were also, I sensed with a
creeping dread, the wrong things. They were answers a child would give.
This was not a philosophy seminar. This was a contract signing. They
wanted specificity. Currency.</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet,” I said, and the honesty felt like a risk. “I came
to find out.”</p>
<p>The shadow-figures rippled. A susurrus, like leaves turning in a
distant wind, passed through them. It felt like disapproval.</p>
<p><em>The candidate is unformed,</em> pressed another voice, older,
grainier. A man’s voice, etched with the static of a far older
recording. <em>The vessel is cracked. It will not hold.</em></p>
<p><em>She is of the blood,</em> countered a third, lighter, almost
melodic. <em>The blood remembers the shape of the vessel. It can be
sealed.</em></p>
<p><em>With what?</em> the first voice returned. <em>Her breath is thin.
Her memories are borrowed. She is a echo of an echo. What life does she
offer to the foundation?</em></p>
<p>I stood up. The movement was too quick, a jerk of defiance. The lamp
flame guttered. The shadows swelled, agitated. “I am not an echo. I am
Ameena Zainal. I remember the smell of her skin. I remember the sound of
this house in a dry season. I remember the weight of the silence after
she died. That is mine. That is my Self.”</p>
<p>The shadow-Zahra lifted a hand. The debate ceased.</p>
<p><em>Memory is not life,</em> it intoned. <em>It is a reflection. The
binding requires a pulse. A future tense. What will you give up, Ameena
Zainal, to become the Keeper? Not what you have. What you will
have.</em></p>
<p>The question hung in the oil-thick air. I understood my error.
Daniel, the diaries, the locket—they had led me to believe the binding
was about the past. About anchoring myself to what was. But the house
was not a museum. It was a living system. It didn’t feed on nostalgia.
It fed on potential. On unlived days.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” My voice was a whisper.</p>
<p><em>The house is hungry,</em> the shadow-Zahra said, simple as a
fact. <em>The last Keeper’s offering is spent. The mortar weakens. The
memories in the wood grow faint. A new binding requires a new
sustenance. A sacrifice of becoming.</em></p>
<p>It stepped closer. The darkness where its face should be was a
vortex. I felt a pull, not on my body, but on my timeline. The sense of
a thread being followed forward from this moment, into all my possible
tomorrows.</p>
<p><em>You are an architect of spaces,</em> the voice pressed. <em>You
build structures for the future. Your Self is your craft. Your vision.
Your ability to shape what is not yet.</em></p>
<p>A cold clarity washed over me. They didn’t want a memory. They wanted
a foreclosure.</p>
<p>“If I bind my Self… my future work… to the house… what happens?”</p>
<p><em>The house will be sustained. Its memory will hold. Its walls will
stand. Your skill, your reputation, the legacy of your hands—it will
feed the foundation. It will become part of the house’s story. And the
house will become the sole subject of your story.</em></p>
<p>“I would only ever build for it,” I said, the horror dawning. “I
would only ever restore, reinforce, glorify this one place. My career…
my name… would belong to it.”</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>“And if I refuse?”</p>
<p>The shadow-Zahra gestured, a slow sweep of its arm. The other shadows
dissolved, streaming towards the walls, seeping into the cracks between
the <em>belian</em> planks. I heard them then, not with my ears but in
the roots of my teeth: a low, collective groan of wood under immense
strain. A crack, sharp as a gunshot, echoed from somewhere deep in the
belly of the house. The floor tilted, just a fraction, a sickening
lurch.</p>
<p>The house was showing me its teeth.</p>
<p><em>Without a binding, the forgetting accelerates,</em> the shadow
said. <em>The stories unravel. The walls will not fall in a day, or a
year. They will soften. They will blur. The world will forget how to see
them. And the things the house holds… will become unmoored. They will
seek new anchors. In the land. In the people nearby. In you.</em></p>
<p>It was the true threat. Not collapse, but leakage. A psychic seepage.
The sorrows and joys and rages held in the wood for a century, bleeding
out into the world, seeking chaotic, random purchase. The chaos Daniel
had feared.</p>
<p>I thought of my flat in London, my desk with its tidy plans for a
community library in Bristol. I thought of the quiet, certain trajectory
of my life—respect, influence, a body of work that was <em>mine</em>. A
future I had built with my own two hands, thought by thought.</p>
<p>To bind that here was to strangle it in the cradle. It was to become
a nun in a silent, hungry order. My creativity, my professional soul,
offered up on a stone plinth to keep a secret history from poisoning the
present.</p>
<p>It was a devil’s bargain. And it was the only bargain on the
table.</p>
<p>The shadow-Zahra watched, waiting. The house held its breath.</p>
<p>“I need to see it,” I said, my throat tight. “The pillar. Where it
happens.”</p>
<p>The shadow inclined its head. It turned and flowed through the closed
door. I picked up the lamp, my hand trembling so the light jittered
wildly. The corridor outside was a tunnel of darkness. The shadow-guide
moved ahead, a drifting smudge against the greater black.</p>
<p>We did not go down the main stairs. We turned into a servants’
passage I had only glimpsed on the plans, a narrow throat of a hallway
behind the kitchen. The air grew colder, damper. The walls here were not
polished <em>belian</em>, but rough plaster, sweating with condensation.
The shadow slipped down a steep, twisting staircase of brick, worn
smooth in the centres by generations of unseen feet.</p>
<p>I was in the foundation.</p>
<p>The ceiling was low, vaulted brick. The floor was packed earth. The
smell was of cold stone, wet clay, and the profound, mineral silence of
the ground. My lamp light pushed back the darkness just enough to reveal
the central support of the <em>rumah besar</em>.</p>
<p>It was not a pillar. It was a tree.</p>
<p>A massive, black <em>belian</em> trunk, its roots splayed and fused
into the brick foundation, its great column rising through the floor
above to hold the heart of the house. It had been carved, not with
intricate patterns, but with words. Lines of Jawi script, Malay,
English, Chinese characters, all overlapping, incised deep into the
iron-hard wood. Names. Dates. Fragments of sentences. <em>…drowned in
the monsoon…</em> <em>…my firstborn son…</em> <em>…the fire took the
photographs…</em> <em>…I forgive you, I cannot forget…</em></p>
<p>This was the ledger. The sacred column. The stone was just its focal
point.</p>
<p>And there, at eye level, a space had been cleared of text. A smooth,
dark patch of wood, waiting. Before it, set into the earth, was the
stone from the garden. The River of Forgetfulness. It looked different
here. Not a grave marker, but an anvil.</p>
<p>The shadow-Zahra stood beside it, blending into the tree’s own
darkness.</p>
<p><em>The Name is spoken here,</em> the voice pressed into my mind.
<em>The Object is placed here.</em> A tendril of shadow indicated a
shallow, bowl-like depression in the stone. <em>The Self is offered
here.</em> The shadow pointed to the smooth, empty space on the tree.
<em>You will lay your hands upon the wood. You will speak of the future
you surrender. The house will drink it. And the binding will be
sealed.</em></p>
<p>I approached. The air crackled with static, heavy with the scent of
ozone and old grief. I could feel the hum of stored memory in the trunk,
a low, sub-aural thrumming. Thousands of moments, pressed into cellulose
like fossils in shale.</p>
<p>I set the lamp on the ground. I took the key from my pocket. The
cold, heavy key. The object of my summons. My intention. I knelt, the
damp earth soaking through the knees of my trousers. I placed the key in
the stone depression. It fit perfectly.</p>
<p>This was it. The point of no return.</p>
<p>I had thought I was making a choice to preserve. I was actually
making a choice to erase. A targeted, willing erasure of my own
becoming. A suicide of potential.</p>
<p>I raised my hands. I placed my palms flat against the cleared space
on the <em>belian</em> trunk.</p>
<p>The wood was not cold. It was alive. It pulsed with a slow, deep
rhythm, like a sleeping heart. It was hungry. I felt its attention focus
on me, a vast, patient, amoral hunger. It did not care about my dreams.
It cared about its own continuity.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth. I would speak my future into its keeping. I would
give it the library in Bristol, the lecture series at the RIBA, the
monograph on vernacular Southeast Asian architecture, the quiet studio
by the canal, the respect of my peers, the legacy of my own name
separate from this place. I would feed it all to the tree.</p>
<p>But as I drew breath to begin the final, binding utterance, the tree
showed me what it wanted.</p>
<p>It was not a list of projects. It was a <em>feeling</em>.</p>
<p>A flash, vivid and brutal: the profound, gut-deep satisfaction of
standing before a building I had conceived and made real. The dizzying
joy of a solution unfolding in my mind, elegant and perfect. The quiet
pride of a line drawn well, a space conceived true. The essence of
creation. The spark itself.</p>
<p>It wanted the spark. Not the buildings the spark would make. The
spark.</p>
<p>To bind that was to become a shell. A technician. I could restore
this house forever, but I would never again feel that jolt of pure,
selfish, generative joy. The house would take the nectar and leave me
the husk.</p>
<p>I recoiled, tearing my hands from the wood. A shock, like static
discharge, zipped up my arms.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The word was a gasp, a reflex.</p>
<p>The shadow-Zahra solidified. <em>You refuse?</em></p>
<p>“I refuse… that.” I stumbled back from the tree, my heart hammering
against my ribs. “You can’t have that. It’s not a thing to give. It’s
<em>me</em>.”</p>
<p><em>It is the offering,</em> the voice insisted, a new edge of
impatience in its silent tone. <em>The Self is the creative force. The
life-blood. It is the only currency of sufficient value.</em></p>
<p>“Then there is no bargain.” I said it with a force that surprised me.
The terror was still there, icy in my veins, but beneath it was a
furious, protective rage. They could have my career, my plans, my
reputation. But they could not have the quiet fire at the centre of my
being. That was non-negotiable. It was the one thing I had that was
truly, solely mine.</p>
<p>The foundation shuddered. The groan of wood was a roar now. From the
tree, a hairline crack splintered up through the carved scripts with a
sound like breaking bone. Dust sifted down from the brick vaults
above.</p>
<p><em>Then you condemn it,</em> the shadow-Zahra said, and its form
began to fray at the edges, streaming back towards the tree. <em>You
condemn it all. And you will bear the consequence.</em></p>
<p>The lamp flame died. Not guttered. Died. As if snuffed by a giant,
wet thumb.</p>
<p>Darkness, absolute and swallowing.</p>
<p>And in the darkness, the forgetting began.</p>
<p>It did not come as a void. It came as a replacement. A false memory,
vivid and warm, injected directly into the space where a true one
lived.</p>
<p>I was seven years old. I was in the kitchen of the <em>rumah
besar</em>, not the cottage. My grandmother was making <em>kuih</em>,
her hands deft and quick. She was smiling, telling me a story about a
mischievous <em>pontianak</em> in the mango tree. The sunlight was
dappled and golden. I felt safe. I felt loved. I had always spent my
holidays here. This was my second home.</p>
<p>I gasped, clutching my head. The memory was beautiful. It was a lie.
I had never been in that kitchen as a child. I had never seen her make
<em>kuih</em>. My memories were of the cottage porch, of watching her
from a distance, of formal, strained teas in the main house parlour.
This new memory was a weed, lush and choking, trying to overwrite the
true, fragile seedlings of my actual past.</p>
<p>I fought it. I clung to the real memory: the smell of rust on my
suitcase, the deep sigh of the house eating the rain, the cold key in my
hand. <em>I am Ameena Zainal. I was afraid of this place.</em></p>
<p>Another wave. A memory of my mother, laughing, swinging me onto the
wide branch of the old <em>jambu</em> tree in the garden. We were happy
here. We were a family here.</p>
<p><em>No.</em> My mother hated this place. She called it a mausoleum.
She never laughed within its gates.</p>
<p>The false memories came faster, a cascading flood of warmth and
belonging, each one a perfect, glowing counterfeit. They pressed against
my own, seeking to dissolve their edges, to blend and blur until I could
no longer tell what was real and what was the house’s desperate,
self-preserving fiction. It was trying to rewrite me as a creature of
its own making, a devotee whose love would justify its existence. If I
could not be its Keeper, I would be its convert.</p>
<p>And with each false memory, I felt a corresponding <em>something</em>
leak out of the walls. A cold spot in the air where the false warmth
was. A whisper that wasn’t a sound. A sense of a presence, unmoored and
lost, brushing past me in the absolute black.</p>
<p>The house was unraveling. And it was taking my past with it.</p>
<p>Blind, panicked, I dropped to my hands and knees, scrabbling in the
dirt. My fingers closed around the key, still cold in its stone bowl. I
clutched it like a talisman. The metal teeth bit into my palm, the same
pain from that first afternoon. A point of reality. An anchor.</p>
<p>I had to get out. I had to get to light, to air, to any space that
wasn’t this hungry, rewriting dark.</p>
<p>I crawled, one hand on the rough brick wall, the other clenched
around the key. The staircase seemed to have moved. I found it by
accident, barking my shin on the bottom step. I hauled myself up, step
by step, the false memories now a screaming chorus in my head: birthday
parties in the ballroom, monsoon adventures with a grandfather I’d never
met, secrets shared with a grandmother who was my best friend.</p>
<p><em>Lies. All lies.</em></p>
<p>I chanted it in my mind, a desperate mantra. <em>Lies. The key is
real. The rain was real. The fear was real.</em></p>
<p>I burst out into the servants’ passage, then into the main hallway.
The pre-dawn grey seeped through the high windows, a mercy. I ran, past
the parlour, through the grand, empty dining room, out onto the
verandah. I collapsed against a wooden column, sucking in great gulps of
the damp, clean air.</p>
<p>The false memories receded, like a tide going out, but they left a
residue. A ghostly afterimage of a childhood I’d never had, superimposed
over my own. I felt nauseous, violated.</p>
<p>I looked back at the house. In the grey light, it looked different.
The lines of it seemed less certain. The roofline wavered, as if seen
through heat haze. The wood, once black and definite, now had a fuzzy,
insubstantial quality. It was forgetting how to be a house.</p>
<p>And I had done this.</p>
<p>My refusal had not saved me. It had accelerated the end. I had won
nothing. I had shattered the fragile stasis, and in the process, I had
offered up my own history as the first casualty.</p>
<p>This was the false victory. I had thought choosing my Self was a
triumph. It was a detonation. I had protected my creative spark only to
see the world around me—and my own past—begin to dissolve into chaotic,
hungry fiction.</p>
<p>The house drew a breath, but it was a ragged, wheezing sound now,
full of cracks.</p>
<p>I was still alone. But I was no longer just a candidate. I was a
catalyst.</p>
<p>And dawn was here.</p>
<p>From the edge of the compound, where the jungle began its relentless
reclamation, a figure emerged. Not Daniel. This shape was smaller,
slower. It picked its way across the gravel, holding a shawl tight
around its shoulders.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Lim. Her face, in the weak light, was pale, her eyes wide
with a confusion that bordered on terror. She stopped a few feet from
the verandah steps, looking not at me, but at the house, her head cocked
as if listening to a distant, troubling sound.</p>
<p>“Miss Ameena?” she called, her voice thin. “I… I had the strangest
dream. I dreamed I was a girl again, and I was playing here with my
sister. We were hiding in the attic.” She blinked, her gaze focusing on
me with difficulty. “But my sister died. When she was four. In Penang.
She never came here.”</p>
<p>She touched her temple, her fingers trembling. “Why do I remember her
laughing in this house?”</p>
<p>The hook for Chapter 19 was not in the foundation stone. It was in
her bewildered, frightened eyes. The leakage had begun. The house’s
memories, unbound and desperate, were seeking new anchors in the
living.</p>
<p>And the first victim was standing in my driveway.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-19-1">CHAPTER 19</h2>
<p>The memory was a ghost in her eyes. It moved behind the familiar
brown irises, a flicker of another life, a different childhood etched
onto the worn canvas of Mrs. Lim’s face. The rain had stopped, leaving
the world dripping and raw. The silence between us was not empty; it was
crammed with the echo of her impossible words.</p>
<p>I did not move from the verandah edge. The wood beneath my bare feet
felt grainy, insubstantial. “What else do you remember?”</p>
<p>She flinched, as if the question were a physical touch. Her shawl—a
practical, faded blue thing—was clutched so tightly her knuckles were
bone. She looked past me, through me, to the <em>rumah besar</em>. Its
outline still wavered, a charcoal sketch left in the rain.</p>
<p>“The smell,” she whispered. “Dust and camphor. And the sound of our
slippers on the floorboards. A hollow sound. We were chasing. She was
ahead of me, her pigtails flying.” A tear broke free, tracing the deep
line from her nose to the corner of her mouth. “But her name. I can’t…
it’s on my tongue, but it’s not my tongue. It’s a name I’ve never
spoken.”</p>
<p>The leakage. I had felt it as a pressure, a rewriting of my own
history, a theft of my past. I had not considered it as a gift, a
malignant donation, to others. The house was not just forgetting itself.
It was remembering itself into anyone who had ever brushed against its
shadow. It was seeding its dying fictions into fertile, living
ground.</p>
<p>“Come up,” I said. My voice was flat. The catalyst issuing an
invitation.</p>
<p>She mounted the steps slowly, each movement careful, as if her body
were a fragile vessel holding a volatile liquid. She did not sit on the
rattan chair I gestured to, but remained standing, a sentinel of
confusion.</p>
<p>“I woke with this… this <em>headful</em> of her,” she said, the
colloquial Malay word <em>kepala penuh</em> carrying a weight of
infestation. “It was so bright. Brighter than my own yesterday. I made
breakfast for my husband and I could see her, a reflection in the
window, sitting at a table that isn’t in my kitchen.” She finally looked
at me, and the terror there was a quiet, settled thing. “Miss Ameena,
what is happening? Is this the house? Is it… angry?”</p>
<p>“It’s hungry,” I said. The truth was a simple, ugly stone. “It’s
losing its stories. So it’s taking new ones. Making new ones.”</p>
<p>“But why me? I just clean. I bring groceries.”</p>
<p>“You have a history here. A long one. Your mother worked here. You
played here as a child. You are a thread in its tapestry. When the weave
unravels, the threads seek new cloth to bind.” The architectural
metaphor fell from my lips, cold and professional. A diagnosis. “You are
an anchor point.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, not in denial, but in a futile attempt to
dislodge the presence. “She feels so real. This little girl. She wants
to play. She’s asking me to find her, in the attic.”</p>
<p>A cold needle slid between my ribs. The attic. The heart of the
silence, the place where the house’s breath originated. Where I had
sealed my refusal.</p>
<p>“You will not go into the house, Mrs. Lim.” It was an order.</p>
<p>“But she’s <em>there</em>,” she insisted, a plaintive, childish note
entering her voice. It was not her own. It was the ghost-sister’s,
speaking through her. “She’s hiding. She’s scared of the man with the
quiet shoes.”</p>
<p>The air left my lungs. <em>The man with the quiet shoes</em>. Daniel.
The Watcher in the attic, the enforcer of the narrative. He was part of
the memory, too. He was being written into her borrowed past.</p>
<p>This was the acceleration. The unbound fiction was not a passive
cloud; it was associative, intelligent. It was using Mrs. Lim’s
vulnerability to pull me back to the source. To complete the story it
wanted told.</p>
<p>“Listen to me,” I said, stepping closer. I took her cold hands in
mine. They were trembling. “What you are remembering is not yours. It is
a… a draft. A story the house is telling itself to stay alive. If you go
in, if you feed it with your belief, you will become a character in it.
You might not come back out as yourself.”</p>
<p>“Where would I go?” Her question was a whisper of profound
despair.</p>
<p>“Into the story. You would be the sister who lived. Or the sister who
died. You would fill a role. And the you that has lived sixty-seven
years in Kampung Pandan would… fade. Like a pencil sketch rubbed
out.”</p>
<p>She pulled her hands away, wrapping her arms around herself. She
stared at the house with new horror. It was no longer a decaying
building; it was a predator with a gentle, nostalgic smile. “What can we
do?”</p>
<p><em>We</em>. The word hung between us. I had chosen my Self. I had
declared my independence. And yet, here was the consequence, standing
before me in a faded blue shawl. My victory had created collateral
damage. To protect my identity, I had to help her protect hers. The
singularity of my choice was already a fiction.</p>
<p>“We need to understand what memory it’s trying to rebuild,” I said.
“The specific one. It’s latching onto you for a reason. Your mother was
a maid here in the 1960s, yes?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Until the late 70s. I would come after school
sometimes.”</p>
<p>“And your sister. The real one. She died in Penang. Of what?”</p>
<p>“Fever. Very fast. One week.” The real memory was stark, unadorned. A
factual tragedy.</p>
<p>“So the house is not just inserting a ghost. It’s creating a
<em>living</em> sibling for you. One that existed here, in this
compound. A companion.” I paced the short length of the verandah, the
gears of analysis turning, a futile attempt to apply reason to a thing
that fed on narrative logic. “Why? What does a living sister provide to
a story?”</p>
<p>“A witness,” Mrs. Lim said softly.</p>
<p>I stopped. “What?”</p>
<p>“When I remember her… in the house… she is always watching me. From a
corner. From behind a door. She sees what I see.” She touched her temple
again. “She is a… a copy of my eyes.”</p>
<p>A duplicate witness. A reinforcement of memory. The house wasn’t just
stealing history; it was trying to <em>multiply</em> its anchors. To
create corroboration. To make its fiction more resilient, more real. If
two people remembered the same false thing, was it still false?</p>
<p>The horror of it deepened, shifting from the personal to the
structural. This was how myths were born. How national histories were
cemented. Not through single testimonies, but through shared,
manufactured recall.</p>
<p>“We need to break the association,” I said, thinking aloud. “We need
to remind you—viscerally, powerfully—of your actual history. The true
one. To give your mind a stronger anchor than the fiction.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>I looked at her, at the deep lines of a real life lived: hard work,
marriage, children, grandchildren, the slow attrition of time. A life
the house had never been the centre of. “You have photographs. At home.
Of your family. Of your parents. Of your childhood in Penang.”</p>
<p>“Some. In albums. In a trunk.”</p>
<p>“Get them. Bring them here. Now. Not into the house. Here, on the
verandah. We will look at them, here in the light, with the house
watching. We will speak the real names, the real places. We will force
your memory to hold its true shape.”</p>
<p>It was a theory. A desperate one. Using physical artefacts as
bulwarks against a psychic invasion. The historian’s last stand: the
primacy of the document.</p>
<p>She hesitated, glancing back toward the gate, toward the safety of
her own home, which now felt permeable. “What if… what if when I come
back, I see her again? In the driveway?”</p>
<p>“Then you look at her, and you tell her the name of your real sister.
You tell her the name of the hospital in Penang. You give her facts.
Fiction hates facts. It can’t digest them. It can only wear them as a
disguise.”</p>
<p>She seemed to gather strength from the simplicity of the task. A
concrete action. She nodded, a sharp, decisive movement. “I will be
quick.”</p>
<p>She turned and walked back across the gravel, her step firmer. I
watched her go, a small figure battling an invisible tide. The catalyst,
setting a counter-current in motion.</p>
<p>The silence after she left was different. The house’s wheezing breath
seemed attentive. It had heard. It knew we were mounting a defence. I
felt a new pressure, not in my mind, but in the atmosphere. A focusing
of intent. The <em>rumah besar</em> was no longer a passive, decaying
entity. It was an engaged author, reacting to a plot twist.</p>
<p>I went inside the caretaker’s cottage. The familiar, shabby space
felt like a theatre set. None of my things—the books, the clothes, the
laptop—held any weight of ownership. They were props. I opened my
suitcase, the one bleeding rust, and dug beneath the folded clothes to
the false bottom. From it, I withdrew my own anchor: the small,
leather-bound album of my childhood. The one with the few photographs my
mother had saved from her own rupture. I had brought it as a sentimental
token. Now it was a shield.</p>
<p>I brought it out to the verandah. The sun was stronger now, burning
off the monsoon damp. Steam rose from the <em>belian</em> wood shingles
of the big house, making the wavering outline shimmer like a mirage. It
was <em>trying</em> to hold its form.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim returned within twenty minutes, carrying a old biscuit tin,
its colourful lithograph of Scottish shortbread faded to pastel ghosts.
She placed it on the rattan table with ceremonial care.</p>
<p>We did not speak. We sat. She pried off the lid. The smell that
emerged was of old paper, naphthalene, and time.</p>
<p>She lifted the first photograph, a stiff studio portrait. A young
couple, seated formally. The man in a borrowed suit, the woman in a
<em>kebaya</em>, her face solemn. “My parents. Tan Yong Cheong and Lim
Mei Ling. Their wedding. 1953. In Penang. At the studio on Bishop
Street.” Each fact was a stone laid in a path.</p>
<p>She handed it to me. I took it, feeling the brittle cardboard
backing. I looked at the young faces, strangers to me, and nodded. “They
look very proud.”</p>
<p>She took out another. A small girl with a bowl haircut, squinting
against the sun in a dusty yard. “Me. Age six. Behind our house in Ayer
Itam. That is my cousin’s bicycle. I never learned to ride it.”</p>
<p>One by one, she excavated her life. School photos. A picnic at Batu
Ferringhi. Her own wedding, a simpler affair. Her children as babies.
With each image, her voice grew stronger, the cadence more her own. The
recitation of names, dates, and places was an incantation.</p>
<p>“This is my sister,” she said finally, her voice dropping. It was a
tiny, square photograph, hand-coloured, the tints too bright. A toddler
with rosy cheeks and black, serious eyes, propped on a velvet-covered
stool. “Tan Ai Lian. Died August 12, 1959. At the Penang General
Hospital. Buried at the Western Road cemetery. Plot number 1147.”</p>
<p>She held the photo and did not cry. She stated the facts, and the
facts were a wall.</p>
<p>We sat in the quiet aftermath of her testimony. The biscuit tin was
empty. Her true history lay displayed on the table between us, a fragile
archipelago in a sea of false memory.</p>
<p>“How do you feel?” I asked.</p>
<p>She was silent for a long moment, looking at the photos, not at the
house. “The other one… she is still there. In the back of my mind. But
she is smaller. She is behind glass. I can see her, but she cannot touch
me.” She looked up at me. “For now.”</p>
<p>It was a temporary fix. A stay of execution. The house’s pressure was
constant. It would find other ways, other cracks.</p>
<p>As if on cue, a sound broke the morning. Not from the house. From the
jungle edge. A low, rhythmic choking. The sound of an engine refusing to
catch.</p>
<p>We both turned. A motorbike was parked askew on the laterite path,
its rider kicking the starter in futile, angry jabs. It was Zahim, the
lanky, sullen teenager from the village who sometimes did odd jobs. He
gave up, swearing loudly, and slumped off the bike, running a hand
through his sweat-damp hair. He saw us watching and began to trudge up
the driveway, his expression one of aggrieved inconvenience.</p>
<p>“Miss Ameena,” he called out, his voice still cracking between
adolescence and manhood. “Phone at my uncle’s shop. For you. A man. He
said it’s urgent. Said you must come.”</p>
<p>A coldness that had nothing to do with the morning damp settled in my
stomach. “A man? Did he give a name?”</p>
<p>“Daniel,” Zahim said, shrugging. “Said you’d know.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim’s hand flew to her mouth. “The man with the quiet shoes,”
she breathed.</p>
<p>Daniel. Using the village’s single public phone. A breach of his
usual, detached protocol. <em>Urgent</em>. The word was a splinter of
ice.</p>
<p>“Did he say anything else?” My voice was tight.</p>
<p>Zahim shook his head, then remembered. “He said… ‘The subplot is
becoming the plot.’ Didn’t make sense. He sounded… not right.”</p>
<p><em>The subplot is becoming the plot.</em> The fictional leakage was
not a side-effect. It was the main event. Mrs. Lim was not collateral
damage; she was the new narrative focus. The house was shifting its
strategy. If the primary candidate refused, it would write a story so
compelling, so populated with believable characters, that the
candidate’s own reality would become the fiction.</p>
<p>I stood. “Thank you, Zahim.”</p>
<p>“You want a lift? My bike’s sick, but I can push.”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll walk.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim looked up at me, her eyes wide. “You’re going to talk to
him?”</p>
<p>“I have to.” “But he’s part of it. He’s <em>in</em> it.”</p>
<p>“That’s why.” I looked at the photos of her life, spread like a
protective circle. “Stay here. Look at these. Do not go inside. Do not
even look at the house for too long. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>She nodded, clutching the picture of her real sister to her
chest.</p>
<p>I walked down the verandah steps, my legs unsteady. The gravel
crunched, a terribly mundane sound. As I passed Zahim, he mumbled,
“Weird stuff happening, miss. My <em>atuk</em> said this morning he
remembered painting this house white once. But it’s never been white.”
He spat on the ground. “Place is going crazy.”</p>
<p>It was already spreading. The infection was village-wide. A subplot
involving a single remembered sister was one thing. A collective false
memory about the house’s colour was another. This was faster, more
aggressive. The house was no longer writing a novel; it was rewriting a
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The walk to the village shop was a journey through a subtly altered
world. The monsoon ditch beside the road seemed shallower, its history
of flash floods less certain in my mind. A particular <em>jambu</em>
tree I passed looked both familiar and strangely placed, as if my memory
of it had been edited. The house was not just projecting memories; it
was editing the present to match its preferred past. I was experiencing
the proofing stage of its desperate publication.</p>
<p>The shop—a dim, cluttered space smelling of dried fish, soap, and
diesel—was empty except for the proprietor, Mr. Gopal, who nodded
wordlessly to the ancient, beige rotary phone on the counter. The
receiver was off the hook, lying beside it like a dead insect.</p>
<p>I picked it up. “Daniel.”</p>
<p>His voice came down the line, stripped of its usual smooth composure.
It was strained, thin, a wire pulled taut. “Ameena. You’ve seen it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen Mrs. Lim. Is she the ‘subplot’?”</p>
<p>“She’s the first point of view. The house is defaulting to a
third-person omniscient narrative. It’s trying to build a world, not
just a biography. It needs multiple perspectives to achieve
verisimilitude. It’s a survival adaptation. You forced its hand.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t force it to torture an old woman.”</p>
<p>“It’s not torture. It’s offering her a better story. A sister who
lived. A childhood here, full of mystery and significance. Compared to a
hard life ending in a forgotten village… which would you choose?”</p>
<p>The cruelty of his clinical analysis was breathtaking. “It’s not
real.”</p>
<p>“It will be. If enough people remember it. Reality is a consensus,
Ameena. You, of all people, know that. History is the story told by the
survivors. The house is simply… recruiting survivors for its version of
events.”</p>
<p>I gripped the receiver, the plastic creaking. “What do you want?”</p>
<p>“To warn you. The process is accelerating because you are still here,
acting as a contradictory element. A dissonant note. The narrative must
resolve you. It will either integrate you or erase you. The leakage you
see around you—Mrs. Lim, the colour of the house—these are integration
attempts. If they fail, the next phase is erasure. Your history, your
factual anchor points, will simply… cease to be relevant. You will
become a loose end, and the story will trim you.”</p>
<p>“So I should leave.”</p>
<p>“It’s too late for that. You are the protagonist. The story has
begun. If you leave now, the narrative will collapse into incoherence,
and the house will take everything down with it in a final, chaotic
rewrite. The village, everyone in it, their histories… it will be a
free-for-all. A madness.”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes. There was no exit. Only terrible choices. “You said
you were a Watcher. An enforcer. Can’t you stop this?”</p>
<p>A long silence. I heard a faint, ragged breath on the line. When he
spoke again, his voice was closer to a whisper. “I am not… immune. The
new narrative is attempting to integrate me as well. My role is
changing. The ‘man with the quiet shoes’ is becoming a character. I am
losing my position outside the frame. I am being written in.”</p>
<p>For the first time, I heard genuine fear in his voice. The tool was
becoming part of the sculpture. The editor was being absorbed into the
text.</p>
<p>“What do you remember, Daniel?” I asked softly.</p>
<p>Another pause. When he answered, it was with the reluctance of a
confession. “I remember… a different reason for being here. Not a family
trust. A personal quest. A loss. I’m starting to feel… a motivation.”
His voice hardened, grasping for his old control. “It’s not real. But it
is becoming operative. I am calling you not just as a Watcher, but as a…
a co-character. The plot requires our interaction.”</p>
<p>The hook was in him too. He was fighting his own conversion.</p>
<p>“What do we do?” The ‘we’ was inevitable now.</p>
<p>“The narrative is coalescing around a specific event. The house is
trying to recreate one particular memory with enough force to make it
foundational. Mrs. Lim’s sister is a piece of it. The false colour of
the house is another. We need to identify the core memory. The source
scene. If we can go there, to the place and time it is trying to
resurrect, we might be able to… confront the logic of it. Not refuse it.
Not accept it. <em>Analyse</em> it. As you would a primary source.
Expose its contradictions, its weaknesses. A story you pick apart cannot
sustain itself.”</p>
<p>It was the same instinct that led me to the photographs.
Fact-checking the fiction. But this would be fact-checking inside the
fiction itself. A perilous recursion.</p>
<p>“How do we find it?”</p>
<p>“The memories will guide us. They are all breadcrumbs leading back to
the heart. Follow the strongest falsehood. For Mrs. Lim, it is the
sister in the attic. That is a location and a relationship. Start there.
But not with her. She is too vulnerable. You must go. You must see what
the house wants you to see.”</p>
<p>“The attic.” The words were ash in my mouth.</p>
<p>“Yes. I will meet you there. My… new memories… suggest I have a key.
A literal one.” He sounded disgusted with himself. “I will be a player
in the scene. You must observe. You must be the critic. The one who asks
‘why this detail?’ ‘Why this emotion?’ Undermine it from within.”</p>
<p>“And if we become lost in it?”</p>
<p>“Then we become characters in a better story,” he said, and the line
went dead.</p>
<p>I stood in the gloom of the shop, the dial tone buzzing in my ear
like an insect. Mr. Gopal was watching me from behind his counter, his
expression unreadable. “Trouble at the big house?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You could say that.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. “My father used to deliver ice there. He said on
windless nights, he could hear the house thinking. He said it thought in
pictures, not words.” He tapped his temple. “Pictures that stick.”</p>
<p>I left the shop. The walk back was a dream. The world had taken on
the hyper-real, slightly-off quality of a vivid memory. The light was
too golden, the shadows too sharp. The <em>rumah besar</em> was visible
above the treeline, and for a flickering instant, I saw it not as black,
but as a blinding, spectral white.</p>
<p>The verandah was empty. The rattan table held only the empty biscuit
tin. The photographs were gone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim was gone.</p>
<p>Panic, cold and clean, shot through me. I called her name. No answer.
I looked toward her small house at the compound’s edge. The door was
open, dark.</p>
<p>Then I saw it. A single, square, hand-coloured photograph left on the
top step of the verandah. Not one of hers. One of mine.</p>
<p>It was from my album. A picture of me, age maybe five, sitting on the
lap of a woman in a <em>kebaya</em>. My grandmother. I had no memory of
the photo being taken. I had no memory of ever sitting on her lap. She
was looking not at the camera, but down at the top of my head, her
expression one of profound, unreadable sadness. In the background, out
of focus, was the dark shape of a doorway. The doorway to the attic
stairs.</p>
<p>On the back, in my mother’s flowing script, was written: <em>Ameena
&amp; Ibu. Last visit.</em></p>
<p>But we had never visited again. This was the only visit.</p>
<p>Except now, holding the photograph, a new memory unspooled in my
mind, slick and fully-formed. A memory of a second visit. A year later.
I was six. I was chasing a little girl with flying pigtails through the
upper hall. We were laughing. We were going to hide in the attic. She
was my friend. Her name was Li.</p>
<p>The house had not just taken a photograph from my album. It had
written a memory onto its back. It had made me a witness, too. It had
given me a sister of the heart.</p>
<p>The falsehood was in me.</p>
<p>I dropped the photo as if it were hot. It fluttered to the gravel.
The hook was not just in Mrs. Lim’s bewildered eyes. It was now in my
own manufactured past, sharp and deep.</p>
<p>I looked up at the <em>rumah besar</em>. The front door, which had
been sealed by my refusal, stood open. A deep, inviting darkness yawned
within.</p>
<p>From that darkness, a small, clear voice called out. Not Mrs. Lim’s.
A child’s voice. “Ameena! Hurry! He’s coming! He says we can’t play
here!”</p>
<p>The voice of Li.</p>
<p>The subplot had become the plot. And I was no longer an observer. I
was a character, with lines to speak and a memory to obey.</p>
<p>The house was remembering me. And it was remembering me wrong.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-20-1">CHAPTER 20</h2>
<p>The child’s voice was a fishhook in the meat of my mind. It
pulled.</p>
<p>“Ameena! Hurry!”</p>
<p>It was not an echo. It was a thing made of air and memory and the
house’s deep, wet lungs. It came from the open maw of the front door, a
darkness so complete it seemed to bleed the twilight from the sky above
the compound. I stood on the gravel, the false photograph at my feet,
the ghost of a girl named Li laughing in a memory that did not belong to
me. The hook was set. To pull against it now would tear something
fundamental. I knew this. The house knew I knew.</p>
<p>I left the photograph on the ground. I left my suitcase on the porch.
I walked toward the <em>rumah besar</em>. My steps were not my own. They
were the steps of the girl in the memory, six years old and chasing a
friend, drawn into a game whose rules were written in forgetting. The
gravel crunched, a dry, modern sound against the ancient digestion of
the rain. The air grew colder as I crossed the threshold, not a drop in
temperature but a subtraction of warmth, as if the house consumed that,
too.</p>
<p>The vestibule swallowed me. The door did not shut behind me. It
remained open, a rectangle of murky twilight at my back, a painting I
could step out of. I knew I would not.</p>
<p>“Li?” My voice was a stranger’s, thin and used.</p>
<p>Silence. The kind of silence that is not empty, but full of
listening.</p>
<p>Then, from the depths of the house, a giggle. Silvery, immediate. The
scamper of small, bare feet on polished <em>cengal</em> wood. To my
left, the archway that led to the formal reception room. The shadows
there congealed, then parted. A shape flickered—a flash of white cotton,
the swing of two dark pigtails—and vanished toward the central
courtyard.</p>
<p>I followed.</p>
<p>The house was different. Not in its structure—the same black beams
ribbed the ceiling, the same intricate <em>pucuk rebung</em> carvings
climbed the walls—but in its texture. The dust was gone. The air did not
smell of mildew and neglect, but of beeswax and steamed rice and the
faint, clean scent of sun-dried linen. A lamp glowed on a side table, a
kerosene flame behind frosted glass, casting a warm, yolk-yellow pool.
It was a memory of the house, polished and presented. A stage set.</p>
<p>I passed the long mirror in the hallway. My reflection was a smudge
of movement, a woman in damp, travel-creased clothes, her face pale and
drawn. But in the periphery, just for a flicker, I saw another shape
keeping pace. Smaller. A child in a white <em>baju kurung</em>. When I
stopped, she stopped. When I turned my head, she was gone.</p>
<p>The giggle came again, from the courtyard.</p>
<p>The central courtyard was the heart of the <em>rumah besar</em>, open
to the sky. Tonight, the sky was not the monsoon blanket of my arrival,
but a deep, velvety indigo, pierced by a handful of hard, bright stars.
The rain was a memory here. The air was cool and still. The fishpond in
the centre glittered, the water black and perfect, reflecting the stars
like scattered nails. The ferns and orchids on the raised terraces were
lush, vibrant, dewed as if with morning.</p>
<p>She was there. Sitting on the low stone rim of the pond, her back to
me, kicking her heels against the mossy stone. Li. Her pigtails were
tied with red ribbons. Her small shoulders moved as she hummed a tune—a
nursery rhyme I half-recognised, a melody from a television jingle that
would not exist for another decade.</p>
<p>This was not a ghost. This was a fabrication. A thing woven from the
house’s memory-looms, using the thread of my own stolen photograph. A
profound violation. My skin felt two sizes too small.</p>
<p>“Li,” I said again.</p>
<p>The humming stopped. She turned.</p>
<p>Her face was a punch to the throat. It was my face. Not my face now,
but the face from the photograph album. The round cheeks, the wide, dark
eyes, the slight gap between her front teeth when she smiled. She was
me. She was the me I had been, the me who had visited once and never
returned. The me the house decided should have stayed.</p>
<p>“You’re slow,” she said. Her voice was clear, a little petulant.
“He’ll be here soon.”</p>
<p>“Who will?”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes, a perfect, childish mimicry of impatience.
“<em>Him</em>. The keeper of the rules. He doesn’t like us playing in
the big rooms.” She leaned forward, conspiratorial. “But I know a secret
place. Come on!”</p>
<p>She slipped off the wall and darted toward the far side of the
courtyard, toward the closed door of the library. A door that, in the
real world, was warped shut, sealed by humidity and time. Now, it stood
ajar.</p>
<p>I did not move. “This isn’t real.”</p>
<p>Li stopped, one hand on the carved doorframe. She looked back over
her shoulder, and her expression was no longer a child’s. It was
something older, a weary patience etched onto young features. “Real is
what you remember. And you remember me now, don’t you? Chasing me.
Laughing. The attic.”</p>
<p>The memory unspooled again, slick and vivid. The cool of the upper
hall floorboards under my bare feet. The thrill of the forbidden. Her
pigtails flying like pennants. <em>Come on, Ameena! The best hiding
place!</em> The memory had weight, texture, scent—the smell of dried
cloves and camphor from the storage trunks.</p>
<p>“You’re not a memory,” I whispered. “You’re a suggestion.”</p>
<p>She smiled then, and it was my grandmother’s smile—the sad, knowing
smile from the photograph. “A suggestion the house made. And you
accepted. You’re here, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>She pushed the library door open and disappeared into the gloom.</p>
<p>To not follow was to let the house write the story alone. To follow
was to collaborate. There was no third option. I crossed the courtyard,
my adult footsteps heavy and alien on the stones. I paused at the
library threshold.</p>
<p>The room was alive. Where before there had been sagging shelves and
the carcasses of books, now there were rows upon rows of leather and
cloth spines, neat and ordered. A green-shaded reading lamp cast a cone
of light on a vast, claw-footed desk. In the air hung the familiar,
comforting smell of paper, ink, and old glue. My historian’s heart ached
at the sight. This was the library as it had been. As it should be.</p>
<p>Li was not at the desk. She was by the far wall, where a large, faded
tapestry of a hunting scene hung. She had pulled one corner back,
revealing not wall, but a narrow, dark opening.</p>
<p>“The servants’ passage,” I said, the knowledge arriving unbidden. “It
connects to the kitchen block. And the back stairs.”</p>
<p>“See?” Li said, triumphant. “You <em>do</em> remember. This is how we
get to the attic without using the main stairs. He never checks
here.”</p>
<p>“Who is ‘he’, Li?”</p>
<p>Her face clouded. “The quiet man. The one who walks the halls at
night. He says children are noise. He says we disturb the story.” She
beckoned. “Hurry. Before he hears us thinking.”</p>
<p>She vanished into the passage. The tapestry fell back into place.</p>
<p>I went to the opening, pulled the heavy fabric aside. A breath of
cold, still air sighed out, carrying the faint, metallic scent of old
pipework and dust. The passage was tight, a space for bodies smaller and
more deferential than mine. I had to turn sideways to enter.</p>
<p>Darkness closed around me, absolute. The tapestry fell shut, cutting
off the library’s light. I was blind. I pressed my palms against the
cool, rough plaster of the walls and shuffled forward. The sound of my
own breathing was loud, a ragged engine in the close space. Ahead, I
could hear the faint, rhythmic scuff of Li’s shoes.</p>
<p>“Li?”</p>
<p>“Just follow,” her voice floated back, oddly distant. “It’s not
far.”</p>
<p>We moved through the belly of the house. I counted my steps, a
mindless anchor. Twenty. Thirty. The passage should have ended, should
have delivered us to the pantry behind the old kitchen. But it went on.
Fifty steps. The plaster under my hands changed to wood, then back to
plaster. The air grew colder, damper. The scent changed—less dust, more
wet stone and the dank, organic smell of a root cellar.</p>
<p>“Li, this isn’t right. The passage doesn’t go this way.”</p>
<p>“It goes where the house needs it to go,” she called back, her voice
echoing now, as if in a larger space. “Almost there.”</p>
<p>A faint, grey light appeared ahead. Not electric light, not
lamplight. The cool, colourless light of dawn, or of a moonlit night. I
emerged, not into a pantry, but onto a small, enclosed balcony I had
never seen.</p>
<p>It overlooked a room that was not in the house’s plans.</p>
<p>It was a workshop. Or a studio. Long tables were littered with tools:
delicate brushes, scalpels, pots of glue, magnifying lamps on
articulated arms. But the materials were not wood or paint. They were
photographs. Hundreds, thousands of them, in piles, in boxes, pinned to
corkboards that lined the walls. The light came from a large,
old-fashioned enlarger in the centre, its cold white bulb the only
source of illumination in the windowless space.</p>
<p>And there was a man. He stood with his back to us, bent over one of
the tables, his shoulders rounded in concentration. He wore a simple
white shirt and dark trousers. His hair was grey, cut short. He was
utterly still.</p>
<p>Li stood beside me on the balcony, a small, cold hand slipping into
mine. Her fingers were like ice. “That’s him,” she whispered, her breath
a cloud in the chill air. “The keeper. He’s mending.”</p>
<p>On the table before him, under the bright circle of the magnifying
lamp, was a photograph. Even from this distance, I could see it was
damaged—torn nearly in half, the edges curled and brown. His hands moved
with a surgeon’s precision, applying a minute droplet of adhesive to the
torn edge. He was not using tweezers. He was using his fingers, his
touch impossibly gentle as he pressed the two halves together, aligning
the fibres of the paper grain.</p>
<p>The image on the photograph resolved as the tear closed. It was a
family portrait. A severe-looking man in a colonial-era suit. A woman in
a <em>kebaya</em>, her eyes downcast. Two children, a boy and a girl,
stiff and formal. The background was the front verandah of the <em>rumah
besar</em>.</p>
<p>The man smoothed the repaired seam with his thumb, a slow, caressing
motion. As he did, something shifted in the photograph. The downcast
eyes of the woman flickered upward, just for a second, meeting the gaze
of the viewer. A spark of defiance, instantly suppressed. Then the image
was still again, a flat, documented moment.</p>
<p>He had not just repaired the photograph. He had corrected a moment.
Edited a glance.</p>
<p>This was the engine. This was the source of the house’s false
memories, its rewritten histories. Not a ghost, not a curse. An
archivist. A curator of lies.</p>
<p>He straightened then, as if sensing our weight on the balcony. He did
not turn. He spoke, and his voice was dry and soft, the sound of pages
turning in a silent room.</p>
<p>“You have brought a visitor, little echo.”</p>
<p>Li’s hand tightened in mine. “She’s my friend. She remembers me.”</p>
<p>“She remembers what we gave her to remember.” He picked up a soft
cloth and began to clean his fingers with meticulous care. “That does
not make her a friend. It makes her a substrate. A receptive page.”</p>
<p>Finally, he turned.</p>
<p>His face was ordinary. Forgettable. Middle-aged, with the kind of
features that slip from the mind the moment one looks away. Except for
his eyes. They were the colour of weak tea, and they held no light. They
were the eyes of a man who has spent a lifetime looking at captured
moments, not living ones.</p>
<p>His gaze settled on me, and I felt it like a physical pressure, a
cool finger on the surface of my mind, testing its give.</p>
<p>“Ameena Zainal,” he said. “The last branch. You have a good eye for
detail. You notice the inconsistencies. The door that is too clean. The
scent that is wrong for the season. That is… problematic for a
narrative.”</p>
<p>“What narrative?” My voice was steadier than I felt. “What is this
place?”</p>
<p>“This is the darkroom,” he said, gesturing vaguely at the space. “The
developing tank. Here, the latent images are fixed. The unwanted
exposures are bleached away. The tears are mended.” He picked up the
repaired family portrait. “This family, for instance. The daughter was…
wilful. She ran away with a rubber-tapper’s son. A scandal. It left a
tear in the family story. A dissonance. So, we mended it.” He placed the
photograph on a drying rack. “In the mended story, she fell ill with a
fever. A tragedy, but a clean one. It fits the pattern. The house
prefers patterns. Loose threads are… noisy.”</p>
<p>He looked at Li, and his expression was one of mild reproof. “You are
a loose thread, little echo. A suggestion that became a little too
persistent. You were meant to be a background detail in <em>her</em>
memory.” He nodded at me. “A faint, happy glimpse of a playmate to
soften the edges of her loneliness here. But you started speaking. You
started wanting. You became noise.”</p>
<p>Li shrank against my leg. “I’m not noise. I’m her friend.”</p>
<p>“You are a smudge on a negative,” he said, his voice still soft,
still reasonable. “And smudges must be cleaned.” His tea-coloured eyes
returned to me. “You see the dilemma. You carry the smudge within you
now. To clean her, I must clean the memory from you. It will be
painless. Like turning a page. You will simply forget this… detour. You
will remember coming to the library, feeling tired, and deciding to
return to your cottage. A logical beat in your story.”</p>
<p>He took a step toward a different table, where a tray of liquid sat
under a safe-light. It glowed a dull, bloody maroon. “It is better this
way. The house has a grand story to tell, and your part in it is almost
complete. The transfer to the trust. The sealing of the doors. A
fitting, quiet ending. This… interlude with a phantom child is a subplot
that goes nowhere. It lacks thematic resonance.”</p>
<p>The clinical chill of his words was more terrifying than any spectre.
He was not a monster; he was an editor. And I was a paragraph he found
superfluous.</p>
<p>“And Mrs. Lim?” I asked, stalling, my mind racing against the walls
of this impossible room. “Was she a ‘smudge’ too?”</p>
<p>He paused, his head tilting. “Ah. The caretaker. She looked too
closely at the photographs we left for her. She began to see the seams
in her own memories. She started asking questions of the wrong
portraits. She became a dissonant note. We are… remedying that. Quietly.
Rewriting her connection to the house as one of grief and confusion. A
simpler, sadder melody.”</p>
<p>He selected a small, stiff brush from the table. “Now. You will wait
here. This will only take a moment with the child. Then, for you, a
simple adjustment.”</p>
<p>He moved toward the foot of the balcony. There was no staircase. He
simply began to climb the wall, his movements smooth and uncanny, as if
he were ascending an invisible ladder. His blank eyes were fixed on
Li.</p>
<p>Panic, sharp and chemical, flooded my veins. I pushed Li behind me.
“No.”</p>
<p>He stopped, three feet off the floor, suspended in the air. He looked
puzzled, as if I had uttered a grammatical error. “There is no ‘no’.
There is only the narrative. You are a historian. You understand—stories
are corrected. Histories are revised. This is no different.”</p>
<p>“It is different,” I said, the words coming out in a rush. “Because I
am not a page in your book. I am the reader. And I reject the edit.”</p>
<p>For the first time, a flicker of something crossed his placid
face—annoyance. A wrinkle in his smooth process. “Your rejection is
irrelevant. You are inside the story now. Your will is just another
variable to be accounted for, a ripple to be smoothed.”</p>
<p>He resumed his climb.</p>
<p>I looked around desperately. The balcony was bare. The workshop below
was a treasure trove of tools, but inaccessible. My gaze snagged on the
walls of the studio, on the thousands of pinned-up photographs.
Landscapes. Portraits. Snapshots. A vast, silent chorus of captured
moments. And I saw it—a pattern. In every group photograph, every family
scene, there was someone looking away. Someone with blurred features.
Someone cut out. The edited ones. The silenced.</p>
<p>He reached the balcony railing and swung a leg over with effortless,
chilling grace.</p>
<p>An idea, desperate and half-formed, struck me. He was a curator of
images. His power was in fixing, in arranging. In making the messy past
conform to a clean narrative.</p>
<p>What if I introduced a new image? An illogical one. A piece of noise
he could not immediately classify or correct.</p>
<p>I fumbled in the pocket of my jeans. My phone. A sleek, black
rectangle of glass and silicon, a lump of the present moment. I wrenched
it out, my fingers clumsy with cold. I opened the camera app. The screen
glowed to life, a square of sterile, electric light in that place of
antique, chemical luminescence.</p>
<p>The keeper froze, one hand on the railing. His tea-coloured eyes
fixed on the phone’s screen. He blinked, a slow, deliberate motion. He
looked genuinely confused, as if presented with an equation written in a
forgotten symbol.</p>
<p>“What… is that?” he asked, his soft voice laced with a thread of pure
distaste.</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. I pointed it at him. I tapped the shutter.</p>
<p>The artificial sound of a camera click echoed in the high room. A
blinding white flash erupted from the tiny LED, a starburst of raw,
digital light.</p>
<p>He recoiled as if struck. A hiss escaped his lips, not of pain, but
of profound offence. He threw a hand up over his eyes. Where the flash
had touched him—his hand, his shirt—the fabric and skin did not burn.
They… <em>pixelated</em>. For a fraction of a second, they broke apart
into tiny, shimmering squares of discordant colour before snapping back
into place, slightly misaligned, like a poorly rendered image.</p>
<p>He stared at his hand, then at me, his placid mask shattered. His
eyes were wide, not with fear, but with a kind of furious, bewildered
horror. “That is… not a memory. That is a <em>capture</em>. A theft of a
moment without process, without grain, without <em>time</em>! It has no
depth! It has no story!”</p>
<p>His voice rose, losing its softness, becoming sharp and ragged. The
very air in the room seemed to vibrate with his outrage. The light from
the enlarger flickered.</p>
<p>I took another picture. Another searing flash.</p>
<p>He stumbled back, off-balance on the railing. The digital glare
seemed to unmake him momentarily, to challenge his very substance. He
was a creature of silver nitrate and carefully fixed shadows. My phone
was an assault of instant, meaningless data.</p>
<p>“Stop it!” he shrieked, the sound tearing from his throat. “You are
making <em>noise</em>! Ugly, meaningless noise!”</p>
<p>I grabbed Li’s hand. “The passage! Go!”</p>
<p>We turned and fled back into the dark throat of the servants’
corridor. Behind us, I heard not footsteps, but a sound like rustling
paper, like a hundred photographs being shaken in fury. A dry, angry
wind began to pull at our backs.</p>
<p>We ran blind. The passage seemed to writhe, to contract and expand in
protest. Plaster dust rained down on us. The cold, metallic smell was
overpowering. Li pulled me forward, her small hand an iron grip.</p>
<p>“He’s changing the way back!” she cried, her voice thin with terror.
“He’s trying to close it!”</p>
<p>The grey light of the balcony vanished behind us, swallowed by a
rolling darkness. We were running into a black hole. My lungs burned.
The walls pressed in.</p>
<p>Then, a different light. Not the cool grey of the studio, but the
warm, yellow glow of kerosene. The tapestry. We burst through it,
tumbling into the library in a heap of limbs and panic.</p>
<p>The library was as it had been. The quiet, perfect memory. But it was
trembling. The books on the shelves rattled softly in their rows. The
green-shaded lamp swayed, casting swinging arcs of light and shadow.</p>
<p>“He can’t come out here quickly,” Li gasped, scrambling to her feet.
“The darkroom is… between. It takes him time to fit himself back into a
scene. But he will.”</p>
<p>I stood, my heart hammering against my ribs. The phone was still
clutched in my hand, its screen now cracked from the fall. A spiderweb
of lines over a picture of a furious, pixelating man. Proof. Ugly,
meaningless proof.</p>
<p>“We have to get out of the house,” I said.</p>
<p>Li shook her head, her pigtails swinging. “He’ll just write you
coming back in. He’ll make a reason. A forgotten paper. A sudden storm.
He’ll stitch it into the edges of your mind until it feels like your own
thought.” She looked at me, her eyes—my eyes—wide and serious. “You have
to break the story. A story needs a witness. You have to stop being a
good witness.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“Remember wrong,” she said simply. “On purpose.”</p>
<p>The library door blew open with a crash. Not from wind. It was as if
the air itself had thickened and shoved it. Standing in the doorway to
the courtyard was the keeper. He was composed again, his shirt neatly
tucked, his hair in place. But his tea-coloured eyes were now dark,
burning pools of fury. The placid editor was gone. In his place was a
censor provoked.</p>
<p>“You,” he said, the word a drop of acid. “You have contaminated the
archive.”</p>
<p>He stepped into the room. The books on the shelves nearest him
instantly browned and curled at the edges, as if decades of decay
happened in a single breath. He was bringing the darkroom’s nullifying
energy with him.</p>
<p>I raised my cracked phone again. He flinched, but did not stop. “Your
little light-box is failing,” he sneered. “The battery is dying. All
modern things do. They have no endurance. No <em>patina</em>.”</p>
<p>He was right. The battery icon was flashing red. One more flash,
maybe two.</p>
<p>Li tugged my sleeve. “The photograph! The one outside! You have to
change it!”</p>
<p>The photograph. The hand-coloured one of me and my grandmother. The
seed of this entire false memory. It was still lying on the gravel where
I’d dropped it.</p>
<p>The keeper was advancing, moving with that same, unnatural
smoothness. The zone of decay spread around him. The beautiful,
remembered rug on the library floor frayed and dissolved into dust under
his feet.</p>
<p><em>Remember wrong.</em></p>
<p>I closed my eyes. Not to shut him out, but to look inward. To the
memory he had written. The memory of six-year-old me chasing Li. The
laughter. The attic. I grabbed hold of it, not as a passive experience,
but as clay.</p>
<p>I changed it.</p>
<p>In my mind, I rewrote the chase. We were not laughing. We were
terrified. We were not running <em>to</em> the attic to hide, we were
running <em>from</em> the attic. Something was in there. Something that
sighed with the voice of the rain. And Li was not leading me. I was
pulling her. And her hand in mine was not warm and lively. It was
growing cold. And when I looked back at her, her face was not my face.
It was blurring, fading, as if she were a photograph left in the
sun.</p>
<p>I poured the new memory into the old frame, forcing it, violating the
house’s careful composition. I made it loud. I made it ugly. I made it
<em>noise</em>.</p>
<p>The keeper screamed.</p>
<p>It was a sound of pure, unadulterated agony. Not physical pain, but
the torment of a master archivist seeing a priceless folio deliberately
scribbled over with crude, chaotic ink.</p>
<p>He clutched his head. “Stop! You’re tearing it! You’re <em>blurring
the lines</em>!”</p>
<p>The library around us flickered. For a second, we were in the
decayed, real library—the sagging shelves, the mouldy smell. Then back
to the perfect memory. Then to a grotesque hybrid—half pristine, half
rotten, the books melting like Dali clocks.</p>
<p>“Now!” Li yelled.</p>
<p>We ran, not for the main door, but back into the courtyard. The
keeper’s wails followed us, a sonic wave of distortion. The stars in the
indigo sky above the courtyard smeared like wet paint. The perfect
fishpond water churned, black and oily.</p>
<p>We burst out of the front door, into the real night. The monsoon rain
was back, a warm, soaking drizzle. The air smelled of wet earth and
frangipani and the sweet-rot of champaca. The <em>rumah besar</em> stood
behind us, a black silhouette against the lesser dark, digesting the
rain with its deep, wet sigh.</p>
<p>There, on the gravel, was the photograph.</p>
<p>I snatched it up. The image of my grandmother and me. Her sad eyes.
My blank, childish face. The doorway in the background.</p>
<p>I didn’t hesitate. I took my cracked phone. One last bar of battery.
I opened the camera, not to take a picture, but to use the light. I
tapped the flashlight.</p>
<p>A beam of harsh, white, electric light speared the gloom. I held it
over the photograph.</p>
<p>I didn’t burn it. I <em>examined</em> it. With the eye of a
historian, with the cold, dissecting light of the present. I looked for
the seams. For the brushstrokes of the hand-colouring. For the slight
warping of the cardboard backing. I forced myself to see it not as a
memory, but as an object. A made thing.</p>
<p>And as I did, the image under the light… changed.</p>
<p>The sadness in my grandmother’s eyes hardened into something
else—fear. A warning. And she was no longer looking at the top of my
head. She was looking directly out of the photograph, past the camera,
at someone standing behind the photographer. Her lips were parted, as if
in mid-speech. As if saying, <em>“Run.”</em></p>
<p>And the doorway in the background was no longer just a dark shape.
The door was ajar. And in the crack of darkness, a single, pale eye was
visible, staring out.</p>
<p>The keeper’s eye. He had been there. He had been the photographer.
This was not a stolen memory. It was an original composition. A scene
staged to be remembered.</p>
<p>The photograph in my hands crinkled, the colours leaching away as if
washed by a sudden internal rain. It became a blank, glossy square. Then
the blankness itself faded, and it was just a piece of old, brittle
cardboard in my hand.</p>
<p>I let it fall. It dissolved into a slurry of pulp on the wet
gravel.</p>
<p>I looked at Li. She was standing in the rain, her white <em>baju
kurung</em> soaked through, her red ribbons dark and dripping. She was
fading. Not like a ghost, but like a projection losing its light source.
The edges of her were becoming transparent.</p>
<p>“You broke the picture,” she said, her voice faint, filled with
static. “So you break me, too. I’m part of it.”</p>
<p>“No,” I breathed, reaching for her. My hand passed through her
shoulder, meeting only cold, damp air.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” she whispered, and she smiled my grandmother’s sad smile
one last time. “I was just a suggestion. But it was nice… to be
suggested. To play. To have a friend.”</p>
<p>“Li…”</p>
<p>“Remember wrong, Ameena,” she said, her voice the faintest echo.
“It’s the only way to be free.”</p>
<p>She dissolved. Not into nothing, but into a brief, shimmering mist of
rain and memory, which the night swallowed.</p>
<p>I was alone on the gravel. The house loomed. The front door was still
open, the darkness within absolute and watchful.</p>
<p>From the cottage porch, a weak light flickered on. Mrs. Lim’s door.
It was still open.</p>
<p>The keeper’s words echoed. <em>We are remedying that.
Quietly.</em></p>
<p>He was in there. With her. Rewriting her into a sad, confused old
woman, erasing her sharp eyes and her stubborn questions.</p>
<p>I had broken one of his pictures. I had introduced noise. I had
remembered wrong.</p>
<p>But the story wasn’t over. The house was still remembering. And it
was remembering Mrs. Lim.</p>
<p>I looked at my empty, wet hands. I had no phone. No photograph. No
imaginary friend. I had only the ugly, noisy, illogical truth of what I
had seen.</p>
<p>And a choice.</p>
<p>Go to the cottage, to the old woman who was being edited out of her
own life. Or run into the rain-soaked night, and let the house finish
its final, quiet chapter without me.</p>
<p>The hook was no longer in my past. It was in my conscience. It was in
the open door of a caretaker’s cottage, where a light was burning, and a
life was being unmade, sentence by silent sentence.</p>
<p>I started walking toward the light.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-21-1">CHAPTER 21</h2>
<p>The light from Mrs. Lim’s cottage was a weak, jaundiced thing,
bleeding through the monsoon murk. It did not push the darkness back so
much as stain it, a sickly yellow puddle on the wet gravel. My walk
toward it was not a decision. My body had decided. It was a current
pulling me, the same deep, gravitational suck that had drawn me up the
<em>rumah besar</em>’s steps on that first day. This was the house’s
pull, inverted. Not toward its grand, silent heart, but toward its
periphery, where the inconvenient memories were being quietly disposed
of.</p>
<p>The rain was a cold sieve, filtering the world down to sound and
sensation: the crunch of gravel under my sodden shoes, the hiss of water
on leaves, the wet percussion of my own heartbeat in my ears. I had
passed through Li. My hand had met nothing but the ghost of rain. The
shock of it was still in my bones, a hollow, resonant ache. She had been
a suggestion. A beautiful, tragic noise in the house’s perfect record.
And I had erased her.</p>
<p>Now the keeper was in there, with his soft voice and his clinical
precision, doing the same to Mrs. Lim. Rewriting her into coherence.
Editing her sharpness into senility. Making her story safe.</p>
<p>The cottage door yawned open. From within came the low, rhythmic
murmur of a voice. It was the keeper. His tone was the same as it had
been in the <em>rumah besar</em>—soothing, reasonable, a verbal balm
applied to raw and messy truth.</p>
<p>I stopped on the threshold. The scene inside was a staged
intimacy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim sat in her worn rattan armchair, a faded crocheted blanket
across her lap. She was very still. Her hands, usually a flutter of
activity, lay placid, one over the other. Her eyes were fixed on the
keeper, who sat opposite her on a straight-backed wooden chair he must
have brought from the kitchen. He had poured tea. Two cups sat on the
small table between them, steam curling into the damp air. His leather
folio was open on his knees.</p>
<p>He was speaking, and as he spoke, he wrote in a small, cloth-bound
notebook with a silver pencil.</p>
<p>“…and the confusion is understandable, <em>Mak cik</em>,” he was
saying, his voice a soft engine of revision. “The storm, the isolation.
The mind plays tricks. You thought you saw the girl again. The one from
the photograph. But you know she’s long gone. A memory. A sad, old
memory.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim’s lips moved. No sound came out. Her gaze was not one of
understanding, but of profound, trapped concentration, as if she were
listening to a distant frequency only she could hear, fighting to hold
onto its signal.</p>
<p>“You’ve been a faithful keeper of this place,” he continued, his
pencil scratching. “But the trust is concerned. Your stories… they’ve
become fanciful. They disturb the new owner. You spoke of voices in the
walls. Of pictures that change. We know it’s just the house settling.
The wind in the <em>belian</em> beams. Your eyes, tired from a long
life.”</p>
<p>With each sentence, he looked up at her, his eyes gentle and
implacable. He was not arguing. He was narrating. He was building a new
set of facts around her, brick by soft brick, and the mortar was his
unwavering certainty.</p>
<p>I saw it then. The mechanism. It was not magic. It was a quieter,
more terrible magic. It was the authority of the record. The power of
the official story, spoken calmly, written down, repeated until it
became the only reality. The house remembered, but he was its curator.
He decided which memories were archived, and which were deaccessioned.
Li had been deaccessioned. Mrs. Lim was being retitled, reclassified
under a less troublesome heading.</p>
<p>Anger was a clean, hot wire in my chest. It burned away the hollow
grief for Li. It vaporized the rain-chill on my skin.</p>
<p>I stepped into the light.</p>
<p>The keeper’s voice did not hitch. He did not startle. He finished his
sentence, the pencil completing a neat period on the page, and then he
turned his head toward me. His expression was one of polite,
professional concern.</p>
<p>“Ms. Zainal. You’re soaked. Come in. We were just having tea.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim’s eyes flicked to me. In their depths, a spark flared—a
recognition, a warning—before it was smothered under a film of
confusion. The keeper’s words were a wool blanket, smothering her
fire.</p>
<p>“What are you writing?” My voice was raw, stripped by the rain and
what I had just lost.</p>
<p>“Notes,” he said, closing the notebook but keeping his finger in the
page. “For Mrs. Lim’s file. The trust provides a small pension for
former employees. We’re ensuring her welfare is documented. Her state of
mind is… relevant.”</p>
<p>“Her state of mind is fine,” I said. The words were clumsy, loud.
Noise. “She knows what she saw. She knows what this house does.”</p>
<p>He smiled, a small, sorrowful flex of the lips. “The house is wood
and stone, Ms. Zainal. It does nothing. We are the ones who do. We
remember. We imagine. We… misplace things.” He glanced meaningfully
toward the <em>rumah besar</em>, invisible in the dark behind me.
“You’ve had a difficult evening. The storm, the disorientation. It’s
common for guests to feel… affected.”</p>
<p>He was doing it to me now. Weaving me into his narrative. The
emotional granddaughter, overwhelmed by legacy and weather, prone to
fancy.</p>
<p>I looked at Mrs. Lim. “<em>Mak cik</em>,” I said, forcing my voice
into the cadence of the language she had taught me fragments of. “The
red ribbons. The photograph. You were right.”</p>
<p>Her hands twitched. A tremor went through her. She opened her
mouth.</p>
<p>“She’s tired,” the keeper interjected, his voice a soft wall. “The
excitement of the day. The unfamiliar faces. It’s best to let her rest.”
He stood, placing himself slightly between Mrs. Lim and me. “Perhaps you
should return to the main house, Ms. Zainal. Dry off. Things will seem
clearer in the morning.”</p>
<p>“I broke the picture,” I said, not to him, but to her, my eyes locked
on hers. “The one in the schoolroom. I tore it.”</p>
<p>The keeper went very still. The professional calm on his face
solidified, like wax setting. The gentle curator was gone. In his place
was the archivist whose collection had been vandalized.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim’s breath caught. A sharp, tiny sound.</p>
<p>“You did what?” The keeper’s voice was low, stripped of all its
soothing oil.</p>
<p>“I introduced a flaw,” I said, turning to him finally. “I remembered
wrong. Just like you said. And it worked. She’s gone.”</p>
<p>For a long moment, the only sound was the rain on the tin roof of the
cottage, a lighter, more frantic digestion than the house’s. The keeper
studied me. He was recalculating. I was no longer a suggestible heir. I
was an active contaminant.</p>
<p>“That,” he said slowly, “was unwise.”</p>
<p>“It was necessary.”</p>
<p>“You have no idea what you’ve undone.” He didn’t sound angry. He
sounded… appalled. As if I’d used a first-edition manuscript to light a
fire. “That photograph was a stable node. A fixed point. It held a
specific resonance. A <em>productive</em> resonance.”</p>
<p>“It held a prison,” I shot back.</p>
<p>“It held a <em>pattern</em>,” he corrected, his voice rising a
fraction. “A beautiful, sustained pattern. The house’s memory of her was
perfect there. Self-contained. Harmless. Now it’s… loose. Unstructured.
And you’ve broken the vessel. That energy has to go somewhere. It will
seek new patterns. It will… distort things.”</p>
<p>He was talking about memory as a physics. As a ecology. Li had been a
preserved specimen. I had shattered the jar, and the formaldehyde was
now leaking into the system.</p>
<p>“Good,” I said, the word reckless. “Let it distort. Let it be noisy.
Maybe the truth is noisy.”</p>
<p>“The truth is a story we agree to tell!” The outburst was brief,
startling in its heat. He reined it in, adjusting his cuff. “The house
remembers <em>everything</em>, Ms. Zainal. Every argument, every tear,
every moment of joy and cruelty. Raw, unfiltered, simultaneous. It is
chaos. It is madness. Our work—my family’s work for generations—has been
to curate that chaos. To find the narratives that are sustainable. That
allow life to continue within these walls. To edit out the…
malignancies.”</p>
<p>“Malignancies,” I repeated. “Like a little girl who died scared and
alone? Like an old woman who asks too many questions?”</p>
<p>“Like feedback loops of grief!” he snapped. “Like memories so potent
they become parasitic, that overwrite the present. The house is an
amplifier. A stuck record can drown out all other music. We find the
grooves that are bearable. We play those. We gently… smooth over the
others.”</p>
<p>He gestured to Mrs. Lim, who watched us now with a dawning, horrified
clarity. He was smoothing her over.</p>
<p>“And who decides what’s bearable?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The keepers. Those who listen. Those who understand the weight of
what is held here.” He picked up his folio, tucking the notebook inside.
“You have forced my hand, Ms. Zainal. Your presence is no longer a
neutral variable. Your actions have consequences for the stability of
the record.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>He looked at me, and for the first time, I saw not a bureaucrat, but
a priest of a terrible, silent religion. “I am going to finish securing
the primary subject,” he said, nodding toward Mrs. Lim. “And then I am
going to the house to assess the damage you have caused. To see what
new… noise… you have unleashed. I suggest you be gone by morning. The
trust will finalize the paperwork without you.”</p>
<p>He turned back to Mrs. Lim, reopening his notebook. His voice dropped
back into that soothing, relentless rhythm. “Now, <em>Mak cik</em>,
where were we? You were telling me about the dizziness you’ve been
feeling. The forgetfulness…”</p>
<p>He was erasing her. Right in front of me. With words.</p>
<p>I couldn’t out-argue him. I couldn’t fight him. His authority was too
ingrained, too calm. He had the power of the record, the trust, the
plausible story.</p>
<p>But I had the wrong story.</p>
<p>Li’s last whisper hung in the air between the raindrops. <em>Remember
wrong.</em></p>
<p>I looked around the cottage. It was a museum of a life lived in
service to the big house. Faded photographs of family long gone. A dusty
vase. A shelf of yellowing paperbacks. And on the wall by the door, a
small, wooden-framed mirror.</p>
<p>An idea, ugly and desperate, clicked into place.</p>
<p>I walked to the mirror. My reflection was a ghost—pale,
rain-streaked, hair plastered to my skull, eyes too dark. I looked like
a memory of myself. A bad one.</p>
<p>I took the mirror off the wall. It was light, the backing cheap
cardboard.</p>
<p>The keeper’s voice paused. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. I carried the mirror to the small, clear space in
the center of the room. I knelt, placing it face-up on the worn linoleum
floor. The reflected ceiling light was a dizzying, inverted pool.</p>
<p>“Ms. Zainal, stop this.”</p>
<p>I ignored him. I closed my eyes. Not to remember, but to
<em>misremember</em>. To remember wrong.</p>
<p>I thought of Li. Not the perfect, tragic ghost from the photograph,
but the girl I had known. The one who cheated at checkers. Who hated the
taste of papaya. Who said my name with a laugh in her voice. I thought
of her not as a lost child, but as my annoying, imaginary,
<em>alive</em> friend. I thought of us running through the garden, not
in a haze of nostalgia, but kicking up gravel, shouting about nothing. I
gave her a birthday. A favourite colour that wasn’t red. A silly
nickname she hated. I remembered her wrong. I remembered her loud, and
messy, and <em>mine</em>.</p>
<p>I thought of Mrs. Lim. Not as the fading caretaker, but as the
sharp-eyed archivist of the kitchen. The woman who knew where every
crack in the plaster led. Who listened to the house’s gossip in the
pipes. I remembered her teaching me to peel mangosteens, her voice firm,
her hands sure. I remembered her questions—not as senile ramblings, but
as deliberate, pointed probes into the house’s silence. I remembered her
<em>correct</em>.</p>
<p>I poured these wrong, noisy, illogical memories into the silent room.
I did not just think them. I felt them. The annoyance, the certainty,
the mundane, glorious <em>realness</em> of them. They were not the
house’s curated memories. They were mine. Flawed, emotional,
contradictory.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and looked into the mirror on the floor.</p>
<p>It did not show the ceiling.</p>
<p>It showed a room. A different room. Dark-panelled, crowded with heavy
furniture. A man’s study. And in it, a younger keeper—this keeper’s
father, perhaps—was speaking softly to a man in a suit. The man in the
suit was my grandfather. He looked distressed. The younger keeper was
writing in a notebook. He said, “The incident with the coolie’s daughter
was an accident. A tragic fall. The family has been compensated. Your
wife’s… fixation… is a product of her grief. It is destabilizing the
household. For her own good, and for the stability of the record, we
must help her forget.”</p>
<p>My grandfather nodded, his shoulders slumped. He was agreeing to have
his wife’s memory edited. To have Li’s death smoothed over into an
accident, the family paid off, the grief managed.</p>
<p>The mirror was not reflecting. It was <em>accessing</em>. I had
become a node. My wrong memories, my emotional static, had created a
feedback loop. I was tapping into the house’s raw data, bypassing the
curated records, and the mirror was the screen.</p>
<p>The keeper cried out—a raw, shocked sound. He lunged toward the
mirror.</p>
<p>I slapped my hand down on the glass, not to break it, but to hold the
connection. “Look, <em>Mak cik</em>!” I shouted. “Look at the
record!”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim was out of her chair. She stood over the mirror, her face
ashen. She saw her own employer agreeing to the lie. She saw the
machinery of forgetting being assembled, decades ago.</p>
<p>The image in the mirror swirled. It changed. Now it showed the
schoolroom. Not empty, but occupied. The keeper—<em>this</em> keeper,
younger, hair thicker—was carefully placing the newly framed photograph
of Li on the desk. He adjusted it, stepped back. He wasn’t preserving a
memory. He was <em>installing</em> one. Creating a perfect, beautiful,
static trap for a ghost. Containing the noise.</p>
<p>“Stop it!” the keeper roared. He kicked the mirror. The glass didn’t
break, but the image shattered into a thousand fragments, each shard
showing a different, silent scene of curation, of editing, of quiet,
bureaucratic erasure.</p>
<p>The feedback was deafening. Not a sound, but a pressure. A psychic
shriek of unvarnished history. The cottage walls seemed to breathe in,
then shudder. The light bulb flickered, then blazed with a painful,
white intensity before popping into darkness.</p>
<p>In the sudden blackness, lit only by the afterimage of the bulb and
the faint glow from the open door, three things happened at once.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim let out a long, shuddering sigh. It was the sound of a lock
turning open.</p>
<p>The keeper stumbled back, his folio falling, papers scattering like
startled birds.</p>
<p>And from the direction of the <em>rumah besar</em>, through the
drumming rain, came a new sound. A deep, grinding groan, as of great
weight shifting. Then a crack—a sharp, definitive report, like the
snapping of a giant bone.</p>
<p>The house was remembering. Not a curated memory. Not a smooth, safe
story.</p>
<p>It was remembering everything at once.</p>
<p>The keeper froze, his head cocked toward the sound. All the colour
had drained from his face. His professional calm was gone, replaced by
pure, undiluted dread.</p>
<p>“What have you done?” he whispered, not to me, but to the darkness
where the big house stood. “The structure… the narrative can’t hold
that…”</p>
<p>He looked at me, his eyes wide in the gloom. “You’ve broken the
silence.”</p>
<p>Then he turned and ran. Not toward the house, but past me, out the
door, and into the sheeting rain, fleeing toward the gravel drive, his
figure swallowed by the night almost instantly. He was abandoning his
post. The curator was deserting the collapsing archive.</p>
<p>The cottage was silent, save for the rain and Mrs. Lim’s steadying
breath. I fumbled for her. My hand found her arm. It was thin, but the
muscle under the skin was wire-taut. She was not confused. She was
present. Terribly, completely present.</p>
<p>“<em>Dia lari</em>,” she said, her voice clear and dry as kindling.
He ran.</p>
<p>“The house…” I began.</p>
<p>She gripped my wrist. Her strength was surprising. “The house is
waking up,” she said. “It is remembering all the stories it was told to
forget. The wrong ones. The true ones.” She looked toward the open door,
toward the monolithic darkness of the <em>rumah besar</em>. “It will be
hungry.”</p>
<p>A cold deeper than the rain seeped into me. I had wanted noise. I had
wanted truth.</p>
<p>Now it was coming. Not as a single ghost, or a whispered secret. But
as a flood. An avalanche of unedited time. The keeper had been right.
The house remembered everything. Every cruelty, every joy, every mundane
moment and every shattering sin. And I had just torn off the lid.</p>
<p>“We have to go,” I said, the urge to follow the keeper, to flee into
the anonymous wet night, almost overwhelming.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim’s grip tightened. “Go where?” she asked. There was no fear
in her voice. Only a fierce, exhausted resolve. “It is in the wood. In
the stone. It is in the land. You can run, but you take the memory with
you. It is yours now.”</p>
<p>She was right. The hook was no longer in my conscience. It was in my
marrow. I had grafted myself to the house’s raw memory. I was part of
the noise.</p>
<p>Another sound came from the <em>rumah besar</em>. Not a groan this
time. A melody. Faint, distorted, played on a warped music box. A tune I
half-recognized. It was coming from the schoolroom.</p>
<p>Li’s song. But it was wrong. Slurred, stretched, bleeding into other
sounds—a man shouting, a woman weeping, the clatter of dishes, the drone
of a forgotten radio news bulletin. All the memories, playing at
once.</p>
<p>The house was no longer a silent witness. It was a chorus. A
screaming chorus.</p>
<p>And the front door, that mouth of darkness I had stared into for
hours on my first day, was no longer just open.</p>
<p>It was <em>inviting</em>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim picked up a torch from her table. She clicked it on. The
beam cut through the dark, illuminating the swirling rain, the
glistening gravel path, the towering black shape of the <em>rumah
besar</em> at its end.</p>
<p>“The keeper is gone,” she said. “Someone must listen. Someone must…
bear witness.”</p>
<p>She handed me the torch. Her meaning was clear. The responsibility
had been passed. The old keeper had fled. A new one had to enter the
archive, now that it was in ruins.</p>
<p>I took the heavy, cold cylinder. The beam trembled in my hand.</p>
<p>I had broken the pictures. I had broken the silence.</p>
<p>Now I had to walk into the heart of the breaking.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-22">Chapter 22</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-22-1">CHAPTER 22</h2>
<p>The torch beam was a scalpel. It cut a narrow, trembling tunnel
through the liquid dark, from the porch of Mrs. Lim’s cottage to the
open maw of the <em>rumah besar</em>. The rain was a static hiss, the
world beyond the light reduced to a suggestion of wet leaves and the
looming, black bulk of the house. The path of crushed coral gravel
glistened like a trail of wet bone.</p>
<p>I took the first step. The gravel crunched, a sound absurdly loud and
human against the house’s deep, wet digestion of the storm. Mrs. Lim did
not follow. She was a silhouette against the weak yellow glow of her
doorway, a still, dark comma at the end of a sentence. Her vigil was
external now. Mine was internal. The transfer was complete.</p>
<p>The melody from the schoolroom did not grow louder as I approached.
It grew more complex. It was no longer just Li’s song, the simple,
plaintive tune she’d hummed while polishing silver. It was that tune
played on a dozen different instruments, each one slightly out of time
and out of tune. A violin string frayed to a whisper. A piano key with
felt worn to the wood. A flute breath choked with dust. Underneath it,
woven through it, was the texture of the house’s memory: the slam of a
door from 1938, the crackle of a 1959 wireless broadcast, the sizzle of
oil in a wok from a Tuesday afternoon in 1972, a child’s sob from a
forgotten nursery fever. It was not a cacophony. It was a tapestry of
noise, each thread a moment, now unspooling simultaneously.</p>
<p>The open doorway was no longer just an absence of wall. It was a
throat. The cool, damp breath that issued from it carried the scent—not
of decay, but of over-fullness. Of attics crammed with trunks, of
libraries where books swell and press against their shelves, of a mind
so crowded with recollection it has begun to sweat them out through its
pores. Champaca, yes, and mildew, and the ghost of beeswax polish. But
also the salt-sweat of fear, the cloying sweetness of tuberose at a
funeral, the acrid tang of a man’s nervous cigar.</p>
<p>I crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>The torchlight did not push the darkness back. It painted it. The
grand central hall, which had been a cathedral of shadows and
dust-sheeted shapes, was now a cavern of echoes. The echoes had texture.
They had weight. My light swept over the staircase, and for a fraction
of a second, the balustrade was not merely wood. It was the press of a
hundred hands, small and large, smooth and calloused, sliding on the
grain. The impression faded as the light moved, but the residue
remained—a greasy, psychic film on the air.</p>
<p>The music box melody led me. It dripped from the upper floor, a
distorted lure. My feet on the marble tiles sounded wrong. Too crisp,
too singular. They were an interruption in a space that now hummed with
a million footfalls, layered one over the other like the strata of the
earth. I could hear the click of my grandmother’s heels, the shuffle of
my grandfather’s slippers, the barefoot patter of a running child, the
heavy, deliberate tread of a man in boots. All going nowhere and
everywhere at once.</p>
<p>I reached the staircase. The first step groaned, a long, low
exhalation. It was not the groan of old timber. It was the groan of a
specific afternoon in 1943, when a Japanese officer, his weight precise
and threatening, had ascended to the master bedroom. The memory was not
an image. It was a pressure in the joints of the wood, released now into
the air like a sigh held for eighty years.</p>
<p>I climbed.</p>
<p>The upper gallery was a corridor of doors, each one a sealed mouth.
But the doors were breathing. From behind them came the muffled sounds
of contained lives: a murmured argument in Malay, a burst of
static-laden laughter from a radio comedy, the rhythmic creak of a
rocking chair, the soft, wet sound of a woman weeping into a pillow. The
doors did not shake. They simply vibrated, faintly, like the skin of a
drum.</p>
<p>The schoolroom door was at the end. It stood ajar.</p>
<p>The warped melody was strongest here, but it was no longer purely
auditory. It had a colour. A sickly, phosphorescent green, the colour of
things seen underwater or in the heart of a fever dream. It leaked from
the crack between door and frame, a thin, illusory light that bled into
the beam of my torch and made it seem cheap, artificial.</p>
<p>I pushed the door. It swung inward without a sound, its hinges having
long ago given up their own voice to the greater noise.</p>
<p>The room was a memory seizure.</p>
<p>The small tables, the tiny chairs, the faded alphabet charts on the
wall—they were all there. But they were not still. They were flickering.
Not in place, but in time. One moment, the chairs were empty. The next,
they were occupied by translucent, shifting impressions of children—Li
as a girl, my father as a solemn-eyed boy, other children whose names
were lost to me, their forms sketched in light and dust motes. They
appeared, bent over slates, then dissolved into the after-image of a
violent sweep of an arm clearing a table, then reformed as empty
furniture again. The alphabet chart showed letters, then showed them
bleeding like ink in the rain, then showed a stark, propaganda poster in
Japanese, then returned to letters.</p>
<p>In the centre of the room, on the low teacher’s dais, the music box
played itself. Its lacquered wood case was splintered, as if from
within. The tiny brass cylinder turned, its pins plucking at the steel
comb, but the sound it produced was not its own. It was a drain. A focal
point. The memories of the house were being pulled toward it, filtered
through its mechanism, and spat out as this distorted, all-encompassing
refrain.</p>
<p>And beside it, standing with her back to me, was a figure.</p>
<p>It was Li. But not the Li I had met in the kampung, aged and shrunken
by time. This was Li as the house remembered her most fiercely: young,
perhaps sixteen, wearing a simple <em>baju kurung</em>, her hair in a
long, dark plait down her back. She was perfectly still, listening to
the cacophonous melody.</p>
<p>“Li?” My voice was a dry leaf in a hurricane. It made no dent in the
room’s sonic tapestry.</p>
<p>She did not turn. She raised a hand, a gentle, silencing gesture. She
was not listening <em>to</em> the music. She was listening <em>for</em>
something within it.</p>
<p>I stepped closer, the floorboards whispering their catalogue of petty
sorrows beneath me. I saw her profile. Her face was calm, but her eyes
were moving rapidly, as if watching a complex play unfold in the air
before her.</p>
<p>“It is all here,” she said. Her voice was not the old woman’s rasp.
It was clear, young, and layered with the same echo that filled the
house. It was her voice, and also the whisper of the rain on the
<em>belian</em> wood, and the sigh of the old cook who died in his sleep
by the kitchen fire. “You opened the lock. You broke the pictures. Now
it plays. It cannot stop.”</p>
<p>“How do I turn it off?” I asked, the question itself a profound
stupidity. You could not turn off a forest by uprooting one tree. You
could not silence an ocean by holding your hand over a wave.</p>
<p>Finally, she turned her head. Her eyes met mine. They were not the
eyes of a girl. They were deep, pooled with decades, with the memories
she had absorbed not as a keeper, but as a fixture. As part of the
house’s furniture of suffering.</p>
<p>“You do not turn it off,” she said. “You find the thread. The one
thread that matters. The one that started the knot. You pull that, and
the rest… may still be tangled, but it will lie quiet.”</p>
<p>“What thread? What knot?”</p>
<p>She gestured to the swirling room, the flickering children, the
bleeding alphabet. “The silence was a story. A story the house agreed to
tell. One pain, one shame, so loud it drowned out all the others. A
sacrifice of memory to keep the rest buried.” Her young-old eyes held a
terrible pity. “Your grandmother’s story. The story of the baby in the
well.”</p>
<p>The words landed in the centre of the room. For a second, the
flickering stopped. The phantom children froze. The music box stuttered.
All the layered sounds drew in a breath.</p>
<p>Then the memory avalanche shifted. The focus turned.</p>
<p>The schoolroom dissolved.</p>
<p>Not around me, but <em>through</em> me. I did not move, yet I was
moving. The walls bled away, the furniture melted into streaks of light
and shadow. The sound condensed, tightened, from a chorus to a single,
screaming note that was not a note at all, but the raw frequency of
terror.</p>
<p>I was in the master bedroom.</p>
<p>But not as it was now. It was vivid, solid, horribly real. The
mosquito net was white and whole, draped over the grand four-poster. A
single lamp burned on a nightstand. The air was hot, close, thick with
the scent of frangipani from the garden below and the coppery tang of
blood.</p>
<p>My grandmother, Dayang Zainal, was on the bed. She was young,
beautiful, her face sheened with sweat and contorted in a pain that was
beyond physical. She was in labour. But she was utterly, utterly silent.
Her jaws were clamped shut, her eyes wide and unseeing, fixed on the
carved rosewood canopy above her. A Malay midwife, a woman I did not
recognise, worked between her legs, her face grim. Another woman, older,
hovered with towels and a basin of water that was already pink.</p>
<p>This was not a ghost. This was the house’s memory of the event,
etched into the very molecules of the air, into the fibres of the
bedsheet, into the grain of the floor where a drop of sweat had fallen.
I was not watching it. I was immersed in it. I could feel the oppressive
heat, smell the blood, taste the collective, stifled panic in the
room.</p>
<p>The door opened. My grandfather, Hassan Zainal, stood there. He was
in his forties, stern, impeccably dressed in a white linen suit, as if
he had just come from a business meeting. His eyes went to the bed, to
his wife’s silent agony, to the blood.</p>
<p>“Is it done?” His voice was a cold stone dropped into the thick
air.</p>
<p>The midwife looked up, her hands still busy. “Soon, <em>Tuan</em>. It
is coming.”</p>
<p>“The child,” he said. “Is it whole?”</p>
<p>The midwife hesitated. A fraction of a second. But it was enough. My
grandfather’s face, a face I knew only from formal portraits, hardened
into something inhuman. He took a step into the room. His presence was a
violation. This was a woman’s space, a space of blood and life, and he
filled it with a cold, judicial fury.</p>
<p>“Answer me.”</p>
<p>The midwife did not look at him. She spoke to the older woman in
rapid, low Malay. I caught the words. “<em>Lambat.</em>” Too slow.
“<em>Susah.</em>” Difficult.</p>
<p>On the bed, my grandmother gave a final, shuddering push. A final,
silent scream that tore through her body but made no sound. The midwife
caught the baby. A tiny, limp form, slick with blood and vernix.</p>
<p>The room held its breath. The midwife wiped the infant’s face,
cleared its mouth. She waited. She rubbed its back.</p>
<p>No cry.</p>
<p>The older woman made a small, choked sound, like a bird being stepped
on.</p>
<p>My grandfather took another step. “Well?”</p>
<p>The midwife looked at the child, then at my grandmother’s exhausted,
vacant face, then at the floor. “I am sorry, <em>Tuan</em>. The child
is… it did not breathe.”</p>
<p>A lie. It was a lie so palpable it thickened the air. I could see it.
The child, a boy, was small, but his chest gave the faintest, tiniest
flutter. A gasp, not a cry. A whisper of life, not its announcement. The
midwife saw it too. Her eyes widened a fraction before she deliberately
looked away, wrapping the tiny form in a white cloth, obscuring its
face.</p>
<p>My grandmother turned her head on the pillow. Her eyes, those dark,
intelligent eyes I knew from a single photograph, focused for the first
time. They went from her husband’s stony face to the bundled cloth in
the midwife’s arms. She saw the lie. She saw the midwife’s averted gaze.
She saw her husband’s calculating, furious stillness.</p>
<p>And she understood.</p>
<p>To bear a daughter was a disappointment. To bear a stillborn son was
a tragedy. But to bear a sickly son, a weak heir, a boy who might not
live, who would be a source of pity and whispered speculation… that was
an imperfection. A stain on the lineage. A crack in the flawless facade
of the Zainal fortune.</p>
<p>My grandfather gave a single, slow nod. Not of grief. Of decision.
“See to my wife,” he said, his voice devoid of all inflection. “Dispose
of it.”</p>
<p>He turned and left the room, closing the door softly behind him. The
click of the latch was the loudest sound yet.</p>
<p>The moment he was gone, the midwife unwrapped the cloth. The baby’s
mouth opened in a soundless mewl. Its limbs twitched. Alive.
Frighteningly alive.</p>
<p>My grandmother pushed herself up on her elbows. “Give him to me.” Her
voice was a raw scrape.</p>
<p>The midwife shook her head, tears in her eyes. “<em>Puan</em>, you
cannot. The <em>Tuan</em> has said…”</p>
<p>“Give him to ME!”</p>
<p>The older woman whimpered. The midwife, torn, terrified, took a step
toward the bed. Then she stopped. She looked at the door. The authority
of the man who had just left was a physical presence, heavier than the
monsoon air. To disobey was unthinkable. It meant ruin, perhaps
worse.</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” the midwife whispered. “I am so sorry.”</p>
<p>She re-wrapped the child, tightly this time, and hurried from the
room. The older woman followed, casting one last, agonised look at my
grandmother.</p>
<p>Dayang was alone. Alone in the vast bed, in the vast room, in the
vast, swallowing house. The silence she had maintained throughout her
labour broke. A sound came from her, low and animal, a howl of loss and
betrayal that was absorbed instantly by the <em>belian</em> wood, drunk
down like the rain. She clawed at the sheets, her body shaking with a
violence that had nothing to do with childbirth.</p>
<p>The memory scene began to fray at the edges, to bleed into others. I
saw flashes, fragments, as the house’s recollection spiralled out from
this central, poisoned root.</p>
<p><em>The midwife, later that night, her face grey with horror,
carrying a small, heavy bundle wrapped in oilcloth through the
monsoon-dark garden toward the old, disused well.</em> <em>My
grandfather, the next morning, composing a telegram to family in
Singapore announcing the tragic stillbirth of a son.</em> <em>My
grandmother, days later, standing at her bedroom window, staring at the
well cover with eyes that were dry and dead as stone.</em> <em>Li, then
a young maid, being summoned to the master’s study. Hassan Zainal, his
back to her, speaking to the window. “The mistress is unwell.
Distraught. She may speak of… fancies. Of a child that lived. You will
hear nothing. You will see nothing. You will remember nothing. Is that
clear?” His voice offered not a request, but a choice between compliance
and oblivion.</em> <em>Li, bowing her head, whispering, “Yes, Tuan.” The
hook settling into her young soul.</em></p>
<p>The memories accelerated, a torrent of consequence.</p>
<p><em>My grandmother’s subsequent pregnancies. A daughter, my aunt,
born a year later. My father, born two years after that. A healthy,
loud, perfect son. The heir. But Dayang’s eyes never lost their
deadness. She moved through the house like a elegant ghost, performing
the duties of a </em>nyonya<em>, hosting parties, raising children, all
while carrying the silent, screaming knowledge in her womb where her
firstborn had been.</em> <em>Her relationship with my grandfather, a
cold, formal arrangement of mutual contempt. His guilt was not remorse;
it was anger at being forced into an act that marred his own self-image.
Her grief was a constant, quiet rebellion.</em> <em>The house itself,
absorbing it all. The suppressed screams, the stifled tears, the lies
told over dinner, the way my grandmother would sometimes stop and place
a hand on a particular floorboard, a particular doorframe, as if
listening for an echo from the stones of the well.</em> <em>And Li.
Always Li. Watching. Listening. Remembering what she was ordered to
forget. Becoming the repository for the truth. The living, breathing
archive of the house’s original sin. The chosen keeper of the one story
so loud it had to be used to silence all others.</em></p>
<p>The schoolroom snapped back into focus around me. I was on my knees.
The torch had fallen from my hand, its beam pointing uselessly at the
wall, illuminating a chart of multiplication tables that flickered
between numbers and the image of a well cover.</p>
<p>The music box played on, but the melody had changed. It was Li’s song
again, but pure now, unsullied. A lullaby. A lament for a child who
never had a name, who existed only as a secret and a scar.</p>
<p>Li—the memory-echo of young Li—stood over me. Her face was wet with
tears that were not her own, but the house’s condensed sorrow.</p>
<p>“The knot,” she said softly. “The one pain chosen to bear the weight
of all the others. A mother’s grief for her murdered child. Loud enough
to drown out the petty cruelties, the daily betrayals, the slow poison
of a bad marriage. The house agreed. It held that one memory in its
front room, like a monstrous heirloom. And in return, it asked for
silence on everything else. A bargain. A terrible, necessary
bargain.”</p>
<p>I understood now. The “ghost” of the <em>rumah besar</em> was not a
spirit. It was a narrative device. A focal point for all the unspoken
pain of generations. My grandmother’s agony became the lightning rod for
every other agony. The servants’ hardships, the children’s loneliness,
the colonial humiliations, the wartime fears—all were channeled into
that one, central story. The house became a silent witness to one crime,
so it could be a silent accomplice to a thousand smaller ones.</p>
<p>And I had broken the vessel. I had demanded the truth of the ghost,
and in doing so, I had not set it free. I had shattered the container,
releasing the entire pressurized history it was designed to hold.</p>
<p>“She knew,” I whispered, my throat raw. “My grandmother. She knew I
would come. She wanted me to break it.”</p>
<p>Li’s echo nodded. “She wanted the silence to end. Even if the noise
was unbearable. She wanted someone to know her son existed. If only for
a moment. If only in terror.”</p>
<p>I looked at the music box, the source of the unraveling song. “How do
I stop this?”</p>
<p>“You cannot stop the song,” she said. “But you can complete it. You
can give the memory a place to go. It is flooding because it has no
banks. No shape. You must give it a shape. You must bear witness, not as
a listener, but as a scribe.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“The house has shown you the root. Now you must acknowledge it. Out
loud. Here. In the heart of the noise. You must speak the truth the
house was built to hide.”</p>
<p>She began to fade, the young Li dissolving into the green-tinged air,
her form becoming one with the flickering children, the bleeding
letters. “The story was a dam. You have broken the dam. Now you must
channel the flood, or it will wash everything away. Even you.”</p>
<p>She was gone.</p>
<p>I was alone in the schoolroom with the screaming music box.</p>
<p>I climbed to my feet. My body felt ancient, weighed down by the grief
of decades that were not mine. I walked to the dais. The music box was a
vortex of sensation. Up close, I could see not just the splintered wood,
but tiny, impossible details within the fracture: the pattern of my
grandmother’s bedsheet, the weave of the midwife’s <em>sarong</em>, the
cold sheen of the well water.</p>
<p>I reached out. I did not touch the box. I placed my hands flat on the
teacher’s desk, on either side of it. I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>And I began to speak.</p>
<p>I did not speak as Ameena Zainal, architectural historian. I spoke as
the house. I gave voice to its deepest, most forbidden memory.</p>
<p>“There was a child,” I said, and my voice was not my own. It was
layered, multiplied, echoing with the timbre of the <em>belian</em>
beams, the sigh of the marble, the whisper of the rain. “A son. Born to
Dayang and Hassan Zainal on the night of the seventeenth of July, 1947.
He lived. He breathed. His name was never spoken. He was carried to the
old well in the south garden, and he was given to the water. This is
true. This happened. The house saw it. The house remembers.”</p>
<p>As I spoke, the music box faltered. The warped melody hiccupped. The
chaotic overlay of sounds—the radios, the arguments, the weeping—drew
back, as if listening.</p>
<p>I pushed on, the words a dredge, pulling up the black, heavy truth.
“Hassan Zainal ordered it. Dayang Zainal knew it. Li Siew Mei witnessed
it. The house held the secret. It used the mother’s grief to silence all
other grief. It made a tomb of memory to protect the living from their
own history. This is true. This happened.”</p>
<p>With each declaration, the room grew quieter. The flickering images
slowed, stabilized. The phantom children sat still in their chairs,
their faces turned toward me, no longer shifting through time. They were
just children, listening to a story.</p>
<p>“The child in the well is the first memory,” I said, my voice
cracking under the weight of the admission. “He is the foundation stone.
Everything else is built upon his silence. I acknowledge him. I bear
witness. His mother could not mourn him. So I will. Here. Now.”</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. The music box had stopped. The cylinder was still.
The last, plaintive note hung in the air, pure and clear, before
dissolving into the quiet.</p>
<p>The schoolroom was just a room. A dusty, abandoned room. The green
light was gone. The only illumination was the weak, steady beam of my
torch on the floor.</p>
<p>The silence was back.</p>
<p>But it was a different silence. It was not the thick, oppressive
silence of suppression. It was the quiet of a storm that has passed. A
spent quiet. An acknowledged quiet.</p>
<p>I felt a profound, hollow exhaustion. The psychic noise had receded,
not gone, but ordered. Given its name. The central, screaming thread had
been pulled, and the knot, while not undone, had loosened. The memories
would remain. They would always be there, in the grain of the wood, in
the chill of the hallway. But they would no longer scream in unison.
They would whisper. They would tell their individual stories, not as a
single, monstrous chorus, but as a library of sorrows.</p>
<p>I picked up the torch. My legs were unsteady. I walked out of the
schoolroom, down the gallery. The doors were just doors again. The
staircase was just wood. The sighing was just the house settling, the
rain digesting.</p>
<p>I emerged into the central hall. The front door still stood open, a
rectangle of lesser darkness leading to the wet, real night.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim was there. She stood just inside the threshold, her hands
clasped before her. She had not crossed it until now. She looked at my
face, saw the ravaged peace there, and nodded once.</p>
<p>“It is done?”</p>
<p>“It is named,” I said.</p>
<p>She stepped forward, into the house proper for the first time since
her retirement. She took a deep breath, as if tasting the air. “It is…
lighter.”</p>
<p>It was. The atmosphere was no longer saturated. It was haunted, yes,
but hauntings could be lived with. Hauntings were stories. What had been
here before was an active, psychic hemorrhage.</p>
<p>“Li?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Her part is over,” Mrs. Lim said. “The memory is no longer hers to
carry. It is the house’s. And yours.”</p>
<p>We stood in the quiet dark. The rain had softened to a drizzle. The
sound it made on the roof was just weather now, not digestion.</p>
<p>But as I turned my torch beam toward the staircase one last time, I
saw it. A small, wet footprint on the bottom step. Fresh. The size of an
infant’s foot. It gleamed in the light for a second, then faded, sinking
into the thirsty wood as if it had never been.</p>
<p>The house had acknowledged my witness. It had shown me a token. A
signature.</p>
<p>The silence held. But it was a silence that had just spoken. And I
knew, with a cold certainty that seeped into the hollow space my
exertion had left, that the naming was not the end. It was the beginning
of a new arrangement. I had taken the keeper’s role. I had channeled the
flood. But a flood leaves a changed landscape behind. The truths were
out now. They had weight. They had consequence.</p>
<p>And somewhere in the quiet, listening dark of the <em>rumah
besar</em>, those consequences were beginning to stir.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-23-1">CHAPTER 23</h2>
<p>The silence after a flood is not peace. It is a held breath. The
water has receded, but the ground is ruined, soft and treacherous, and
everything you knew has been washed into new, alien shapes. The house
stood around me in the aftermath of the naming, and it was lighter, as
Mrs. Lim had said, but lightness in a place like this was not relief. It
was exposure. The saturated dread was gone, and in its place was a vast,
echoing chamber where every truth I had pulled from the walls now hung,
naked and waiting.</p>
<p>I did not sleep. I sat on the floor of the central hall, my back
against the cool <em>belian</em> wood of a pillar, and watched the grey
dawn bleed through the open front door. The rain had stopped. The world
dripped. The house digested the last of the storm, a final, deep sigh
that seemed to come from under the foundations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim had gone back to her cottage. Her work, she believed, was
done. Mine, I now understood, had only just begun. The keeper’s role was
not custodial. It was metabolic. The house had fed on silence for a
century. Now it fed on the story I had given it. The story was alive
inside the timber, circulating like new blood. I could feel it, a low,
sub-audible hum in the soles of my feet.</p>
<p>I stood, my joints protesting. The hollow space inside me, carved out
by the channeling of Li’s memory, had not filled. It had become a
receptor. I was empty so that the house could speak into me. I walked,
not with purpose, but with the slow, passive drift of a leaf on a
current. The torch was dead in my hand. I did not need it. The grey
light was enough.</p>
<p>I passed the schoolroom door. It was closed. The air around it was
still. No whispers bled from the crack beneath it. Li’s memory was no
longer a trapped, screaming thing. It was integrated. It was part of the
house’s biography. And part of mine.</p>
<p>But the footprint on the stair. The infant’s signature, fresh and
fading. That was not Li. That was something else. A consequence.</p>
<p>The house guided me. Not with whispers, not with cold spots, but with
a simple, gravitational pull. I found myself at the foot of the main
staircase. The footprint was gone, absorbed. But the memory of its gleam
was a pinprick in my mind. I looked up. The gallery above was a dark
mouth. The family wing lay beyond.</p>
<p>I had not been up there. Not properly. I had glimpsed it from the end
of the gallery, a corridor of deeper shadow leading to the private
chambers. The heart of the <em>rumah besar</em>. The place where my
grandmother, and her mother, and all the mothers before them, had lived
and dreamed and dissolved.</p>
<p>My legs carried me up. The wood did not creak. It drank the sound of
my weight. The ascent was silent, a dream ascent. At the top, the
gallery stretched left and right. To the right, the schoolroom, the
scene of the exorcism. To the left, the family wing.</p>
<p>I turned left.</p>
<p>The air changed. It was cooler, drier. It smelled of camphor and the
ghost of rosewater. The corridor was lined with doors, all of them dark,
heavy timber, carved with geometric patterns—stars within squares, waves
frozen in wood. The trust’s inventory listed them: the Master Bedroom,
the Daughters’ Room, the Sewing Room, the Prayer Room. I walked past
them. They were not my destination.</p>
<p>At the very end of the corridor was a final door. It was narrower,
plainer. The servants’ access to the upper verandah, perhaps. Or a
storage closet. The inventory was vague here: <em>‘Anteroom, contents
miscellaneous.’</em></p>
<p>My hand rose. I did not decide to push it. The door swung inward on
silent hinges.</p>
<p>It was not an anteroom. It was a nursery.</p>
<p>Small, but not cramped. A single shuttered window, latched closed,
cast slatted bars of pallid morning light across the floor. The walls
were painted a soft, faded green. A simple wooden crib, its bars like
the ribs of a small animal, stood against one wall. A low rattan rocking
chair, its seat worn smooth, sat empty beside it. A changing table, a
small cabinet. It was spare, functional. A world away from the ornate
oppression of the schoolroom.</p>
<p>This was a place of quiet care. Of whispered lullabies. Of
night-watches.</p>
<p>And it was utterly, profoundly cold.</p>
<p>The chill was not the damp of the monsoon. It was a dry, marrow-deep
cold, the cold of a space from which all warmth had been meticulously,
deliberately extracted. It leached the heat from my skin. My breath
plumed, a faint ghost in the barred light.</p>
<p>I stepped inside. The house’s gravitational pull centered here, in
this frozen pocket. This was the eye of the new silence.</p>
<p>My eyes adjusted. There were no toys. No colourful blankets. But on
the wall above the crib, someone had painted a mural. It was simple,
childlike. A tree with sprawling branches. A bright yellow sun in one
corner. A blue bird in flight. The paint was old, flaking in places, but
the colours had once been cheerful. A gesture of love in this austere
space.</p>
<p>I moved to the crib and looked in.</p>
<p>The mattress was gone, leaving only the taut webbing of the base. But
in the center of that webbing lay a single object.</p>
<p>A <em>congkak</em> board.</p>
<p>The ancient Malay mancala game, carved from a single piece of light
wood. Two rows of seven holes, two larger storehouses at each end. It
was the one from the schoolroom desk. The one I had seen in Li’s memory,
clutched in her small, desperate hands. It lay there, clean and dry, as
if placed with ceremony.</p>
<p>I did not reach for it. I understood. This was not Li’s. Not anymore.
This was an offering. A bridge.</p>
<p>The cold in the room intensified, focusing. It drew in from the
corners, from the ceiling, from under the door, and pooled in the space
between the crib and the rocking chair. The air there shimmered, not
with heat, but with a negative density, a sucking absence of light.</p>
<p>And from that absence, a form condensed.</p>
<p>It was not a child. It was the <em>memory</em> of a child. A boy. He
was perhaps two years old. He wore a simple white <em>baju</em>, loose
cotton trousers. His feet were bare. He was translucent, not as a ghost
is translucent, but as a memory is—there were gaps in him, patches where
my eye could see the flaking green paint of the wall behind his
shoulder, the grain of the floorboards through his feet. He was not
solid. He was an impression, held together by will and longing.</p>
<p>He did not look at me. He was looking at the rocking chair.</p>
<p>And in the rocking chair, another form began to resolve. Fainter,
even less substantial. The silhouette of a woman. She was curved
forward, as if leaning over to lift something from the crib. Her form
was made of shifting shadows, the barest suggestion of a
<em>kebaya</em>, a fall of long hair. A mother’s posture. She had no
face. She was a gesture. A function.</p>
<p>The memory-boy took a wobbling step toward the chair. His small feet
made no sound on the boards. He reached out a hand.</p>
<p>The shadow-mother reached down, her arms beginning to form a
cradle.</p>
<p>And then, she dissolved. Not with a fade, but with a violent, silent
<em>unraveling</em>. One second the gesture of love was there, the next
it was shredded into nothing, like smoke hit by a fan. The memory-boy’s
hand closed on empty, cold air.</p>
<p>He stood there, his arm outstretched. He did not cry. He did not look
confused. He simply stood, frozen in the moment of reaching for a
comfort that had been eternally revoked. The scene held: the crib, the
empty chair, the reaching child. A loop of loss. A silent, screaming
filmstrip playing on repeat.</p>
<p>This was the consequence. This was what the flood of truth had washed
into the open.</p>
<p>Li’s suffering had been a wound. But this… this was a cavity. An
absence where a bond should have been. The house had not just witnessed
a murder in the schoolroom. It had witnessed a severing here. A mother,
taken. A child, left in a cold room, waiting for a return that would
never come. The trauma was not violence. It was abandonment. It was the
unanswered cry into the silence.</p>
<p>The memory-boy reset. He flickered back to his starting position near
the crib. The shadow-mother formed again in the chair. He stepped
forward. He reached. She dissolved.</p>
<p>Again. Again.</p>
<p>A silent, perpetual engine of grief.</p>
<p>I understood my role now. The keeper was not just a witness to the
past. She was a witness to the <em>ongoing</em> present of that past.
The house did not just store memories like artifacts in a museum. It
sustained them. It gave them a space to continue happening. Li’s memory
had needed release from its tortured loop. This memory needed something
else. It needed acknowledgement of its eternal moment. It needed company
in its loneliness.</p>
<p>I did not speak. Words were too coarse for this fine-grained agony. I
moved slowly, my own body feeling heavy and too-real in this realm of
impression. I walked to the rocking chair. The cold was so intense it
burned my skin. I lowered myself, not into the chair—that space belonged
to the shadow—but onto the floor beside it. I sat, drawing my knees up,
making myself small. I positioned myself within the memory-boy’s
sightline, but not as an obstruction. As an addition.</p>
<p>The loop played again. The boy formed. The shadow formed. He stepped.
He reached. She vanished.</p>
<p>This time, as his hand closed on emptiness, I turned my head and
looked at him. I met his eyes. They were dark pools, not with
malevolence, but with a depth of waiting that could drown galaxies. I
held his gaze. I did not smile. I did not offer a false comfort. I
simply saw him. I saw the endlessness of his reaching.</p>
<p>He paused. The reset did not happen immediately. He stood, arm still
outstretched, and his gaze, which had always been fixed on the empty
space where the mother should be, shifted a fraction. It moved to
me.</p>
<p>The cold in the room shifted with it. It was no longer a diffuse,
biting chill. It became a focused pressure, a weight of attention. The
memory was aware of me. The loop had an audience.</p>
<p>He lowered his arm. He turned his whole body toward me. The simple,
heartbreaking hope that had animated his movement toward the chair was
gone. In its place was a quiet, ancient scrutiny. He was assessing what
I was. An interruption? A new feature of the room? Another shadow that
would disappear?</p>
<p>I did not move. I let him look. I was a fact. A woman sitting on the
floor of his nursery, seeing him.</p>
<p>He took a step toward me. Then another. He stopped an arm’s length
away. He was so small. The gaps in his form shimmered, showing the
painted tree on the wall behind him. He raised his hand again, not in a
reach, but in a slow, exploratory gesture. His translucent fingers moved
toward my face.</p>
<p>I did not flinch. The cold that radiated from him was paralyzing, a
cold that had nothing to do with temperature and everything to do with
the void of a love withdrawn. His fingers passed through my cheek.</p>
<p>There was no physical sensation. No icy touch. Instead, a memory that
was not mine flooded into the hollow space inside me.</p>
<p><em>Not images. Not sounds. Sensations. The smell of milk and talcum
powder. The crushing, delicious weight of sleep in a warm lap. The
secure enclosure of arms. The sound of a hum, felt through a chest bone
pressed against a cheek. Then… the sudden lightness. The cold air where
the warmth had been. The empty lap. The silence where the hum had been.
A confusion so vast it had no edges. A waiting that had no end. The
slow, chilling realization that the center of the world had gone out,
and nothing would ever be warm again.</em></p>
<p>It was the memory of attachment, and then the memory of its excision.
The amputation of a soul’s first home.</p>
<p>I gasped. A dry, ragged sound in the silent room. Tears did not come.
The memory was too cold for tears. It froze them at the source.</p>
<p>The memory-boy watched me absorb it. He saw the understanding in my
eyes. He saw that I had felt the shape of his loss. It did not comfort
him. Nothing could. But it changed the quality of his loneliness. It was
no longer absolute. It was now shared.</p>
<p>He turned away from me. He looked back at the empty rocking chair.
The shadow-mother did not reform. The loop was broken. The ritual had
been altered by a new element: a witness who had felt its essence.</p>
<p>He walked back to his crib. He did not fade. He climbed, with the
clumsy grace of a toddler, onto the webbing. He lay down on his back,
staring up at the painted tree on the ceiling. He became still. The cold
in the room receded from its painful sharpness, settling back into a
general, ambient chill. The memory was not gone. It was at rest. It was
being kept.</p>
<p>I sat on the floor for a long time, until the bars of light on the
floor had moved and thickened with the rising sun. My body was stiff, my
mind scoured clean by that blast of primordial loss. I finally pushed
myself up. My limbs were leaden.</p>
<p>As I turned to leave, I saw the <em>congkak</em> board in the crib.
The memory-boy was not looking at it. His eyes were closed now, in a
mimicry of sleep. I reached in, my movement slow and respectful, and
picked up the board. The wood was not cold. It was room temperature.
Neutral. A tool.</p>
<p>I carried it out of the nursery, closing the plain door softly behind
me. The corridor felt warm by comparison. I leaned against the wall, the
board held to my chest. The house sighed around me, a deep, settling
sigh. It was satisfied. The new story was being integrated. The keeper
was keeping.</p>
<p>I made my way downstairs, each step an effort. The hollow inside me
was now filled with a foreign, frozen memory. It sat in my chest like a
stone of dry ice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim was in the central hall. She had brought a thermos and two
bowls of <em>congee</em>. She looked at my face as I descended, and her
own, usually so composed, tightened with a deep, weary recognition.</p>
<p>“You found the cold room,” she said. It was not a question.</p>
<p>“The nursery.” My voice was a rasp.</p>
<p>She nodded, ladling the rice porridge into a bowl. “He is not a
ghost. He is a… habit. A habit of love, with no object.”</p>
<p>“Whose?” I asked, though a part of me already knew.</p>
<p>“Your grandmother’s first,” she said. “A son. He lived two years. A
fever took him, in the wet season. She never spoke of it. She had the
room closed. But a house knows. It holds the shape of a mother’s grief.
And then…” Mrs. Lim paused, handing me the bowl. The steam did nothing
to thaw the ice in my core. “When Li came. When she was… left alone. The
house remembered. It offered her the pattern. The cold room. The
waiting. Her loss mapped onto the older one. The house learned how to
hold that kind of sorrow. It became a specialist.”</p>
<p>I thought of the footprint on the stair. A signature. An invitation.
The house, after the naming, had wanted to show me its full capacity.
Its archive of absences.</p>
<p>“It’s not over,” I said.</p>
<p>“It is never over,” Mrs. Lim corrected gently. “You have stopped the
bleeding. You have given the memories their proper names. But the house
is a living record. Your role is not to close the book. It is to turn
the pages. To read. To bear witness.”</p>
<p>“I felt it,” I whispered. “The… lightness when the arms let go.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim’s eyes glistened. “That is the heaviest feeling in the
world.”</p>
<p>I ate the <em>congee</em> without tasting it. The practical part of
my mind, the architectural historian, stirred feebly. It grasped for a
thread, for a task. “The <em>congkak</em> board. It was in the crib.
Like an offering.”</p>
<p>“A connection,” Mrs. Lim said. “Li’s memory is free. His memory is…
curated. The board is a bridge between stories. A game that was never
played. A link between two children the house held.”</p>
<p>A link. The word resonated in the hollow, frozen space within me. The
house was not just a collection of isolated traumas. It was a web. Li’s
story was connected to the memory-boy’s story. And my grandmother’s
grief was the filament between them. Where else did the web lead? What
other sorrows were strung together in this dark, beautiful lattice?</p>
<p>I looked down at the <em>congkak</em> board in my lap. The two rows
of holes. Two sides. A game of capture and store. A metaphor that was
too perfect.</p>
<p>“I need to see the rest,” I said, the words leaving my mouth before I
fully thought them. “I need to see the web.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lim studied me. “You are the keeper. The house will show you
what it believes you must see. But be warned, Ameena. To see the web is
to feel its tension. To touch one strand is to make the whole structure
tremble. You have calmed the waters. To map the riverbed is to stir up
new silt.”</p>
<p>“I have to understand what I’m keeping,” I said. The resolve was a
cold, hard thing, born of the frozen memory I now carried. “I have to
know the shape of the silence.”</p>
<p>She did not argue. She simply gathered the bowls. “Then you should
start with the heart. The place where the most strands knot.”</p>
<p>“The Master Bedroom.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “No. Your grandmother’s room was there, but her
heart was not. The heart of a woman in this house was never the marriage
bed. It was the <em>ruang tengah</em>.”</p>
<p>The central space. The women’s hall. The place where the family would
gather, where the daughters were raised, where the private life unfolded
away from the formal receiving rooms. It was on the ground floor, off
the central hall. I had passed its closed doors a dozen times. The
trust’s inventory listed it as ‘<em>Family Withdrawing Room – Furnished,
items catalogued.</em>’</p>
<p>“It has been shut since the day she died,” Mrs. Lim said. “The trust
has the key. It is in the envelope from the solicitor. With the
others.”</p>
<p>I had not used any of the other keys. The front door had been open.
Every other door in the house had been unlocked, waiting for me. Except
that one.</p>
<p>I went to my suitcase, still in the corner of the hall where I’d left
it on that first day, a lifetime ago. I found the solicitor’s envelope,
the paper damp at the edges. I tipped it out. A ring of old, iron keys
spilled into my hand, each tagged with a faded paper label. <em>Front
Door. Back Kitchen. Strong Room. Family Withdrawing Room.</em></p>
<p>The key was heavier than the others. Cold iron.</p>
<p>I walked to the pair of carved doors that led off the central hall.
They were <em>belian</em>, like everything else, but the carvings here
were different—not geometric, but floral: twisting vines, open blossoms.
A feminine, organic pattern. I fitted the key into the lock. It turned
with a sound like a bone cracking, a dry, resonant shriek that echoed
through the quiet house.</p>
<p>I pushed the doors open.</p>
<p>The smell that wafted out was complex, layered. Dust, yes, and the
faint, sweet decay of dried flowers. But underneath that was the scent
of sandalwood, of sewing thread, of the coconut oil women of my
grandmother’s generation used in their hair. It was the smell of time
spent, of life lived in quiet, contained intervals.</p>
<p>Light filtered through closed <em>jalousie</em> shutters, striping
the room in gold and shadow. It was a large room, but felt intimate.
Low, comfortable-looking chairs and sofas, upholstered in faded floral
prints, were arranged in a loose circle. A large, low table of dark teak
dominated the center, its surface scarred with cup rings and the faint
ghosts of embroidery hoops. Against one wall stood a massive
<em>almari</em>, a carved wardrobe, its doors closed. Against another, a
writing desk, neat and bare. In one corner, a prayer mat was rolled
neatly beside a small, wooden <em>Qibla</em> indicator.</p>
<p>This was not a museum. This was a room paused. A cup sat on a side
table, a dark stain in its bottom. A half-finished piece of embroidery—a
floral motif on a pillowcase—lay folded on the arm of a chair, a needle
still stuck in the fabric, its thread trailing. A copy of the Quran lay
on the low table, a silk bookmark placed partway through. It was as if
the women of the house had just stepped out for a moment, expecting to
return.</p>
<p>But the dust told the truth. A fine, grey blanket over everything,
softening edges, muting colours.</p>
<p>I stepped inside. The air was still, but not dead. It was watchful.
This was the heart. And hearts remember everything.</p>
<p>I moved to the writing desk first. The surface was clean, but the
single drawer was unlocked. I pulled it open. Inside were not letters,
not journals. It was a archive of small, finished things. A baby’s
knitted bootie, yellowed with age. A lock of dark hair, tied with a
faded blue ribbon. A small, silver rattle. A photograph, sepia-toned, of
a serious-looking young woman in a <em>kebaya</em>—my great-grandmother.
A dried frangipani blossom, brittle as parchment. These were the relics
of the <em>ruang tengah</em>. The physical tokens of the web.</p>
<p>I picked up the photograph. The woman’s eyes were dark, direct. She
looked burdened, but not broken. She looked like a keeper.</p>
<p>A soft click made me turn.</p>
<p>The doors to the massive <em>almari</em> had swung open an inch. Not
a creak. A precise, deliberate release.</p>
<p>I walked to the wardrobe. With a gentle pull, I opened both
doors.</p>
<p>It was not full of clothes. The left side held a few hanging
<em>kebayas</em>, beautiful, embroidered, shrouded in muslin. The right
side was shelves. And on those shelves were boxes. Dozens of them. All
shapes and sizes. Cardboard boxes, tin boxes, wooden boxes. Each was
labeled, in my grandmother’s elegant, looping hand.</p>
<p><em>Siti’s First Tooth.</em> <em>Mariam’s School Ribbon, 1938.</em>
<em>Letters from Aziz, 1941-42.</em> <em>Li’s Drawings.</em> <em>The
Boy’s Blanket.</em></p>
<p>My breath caught. <em>The Boy’s Blanket</em>. I reached for that box,
a simple cedar one. I lifted the lid. Inside, folded with impossible
neatness, was a small, white cotton blanket, edged with lace. It smelled
faintly of that same, lost scent of milk and talcum. I did not touch it.
I closed the lid.</p>
<p>This was the web. This was the physical manifestation of the house’s
memory. Not just trauma, but all of it. The tiny triumphs, the small
sorrows, the mundane loves. The tooth, the ribbon, the letters from a
brother or a husband gone to war, the drawings of a child who would die
in darkness, the blanket of a son lost to fever. It was all here.
Curated. Preserved. The <em>ruang tengah</em> was not just a living
room. It was a reliquary for the emotional history of the women who had
lived here.</p>
<p>I found a box labeled simply, <em>For the Keeper</em>.</p>
<p>My hands trembled as I took it down. It was heavier than the others.
I carried it to the low table, brushed the dust from the surface, and
set it down. I lifted the lid.</p>
<p>Inside, on a bed of faded velvet, lay three things.</p>
<p>A large, old-fashioned iron key, black with age. A sheaf of papers,
handwritten in my grandmother’s script. And a photograph of my mother,
as a young woman, standing on the porch of the caretaker’s cottage,
smiling a smile that did not reach her eyes. On the back, in my
grandmother’s hand: <em>Amina, who left. Who chose the wider, lighter
world. Who broke the chain, and in the breaking, left me the last
link.</em></p>
<p>The weight of it pressed me down into the dusty floral sofa. I took
the papers. They were not a diary. They were instructions. A guide.</p>
<p><em>To the Keeper,</em> it began.</p>
<p><em>If you are reading this, the house has chosen you, and you have
chosen to listen. You have named the loudest ghost. You have sat with
the quietest sorrow. You now know the house is not stone and wood, but
memory and consequence.</em></p>
<p><em>My mother kept the house. Her mother before her. It is a lineage
of attention. We do not own the memories. We tend them. We give them a
space to be, so they do not bleed out into the world and poison the
living. This is our service. This is our burden, and our
privilege.</em></p>
<p><em>The key you hold is to the Strong Room. In the cellar. There, you
will find the Deed. Not the legal deed to the land, but the original
compact. The reason the first </em>rumah besar* was built here, on this
specific patch of earth, where the veil is thin. The reason we must
keep.*</p>
<p><em>The trust believes they are taking a historical property. They
are wrong. They are taking a responsibility they do not understand. You
must make them understand. Or you must stop them. The clearing cannot
happen. The dispersal cannot be allowed. If the house is broken, the
memories will be released. Not laid to rest. Released. Like a flood of
black water. They will find new vessels. They will haunt the living in
truth.</em></p>
<p><em>You are the last link. The chain ends with you. You must decide:
do you pass the key to the trust, and let the world break what it cannot
comprehend? Or do you take the key, and become the final
keeper?</em></p>
<p><em>The house has survived because generations of women have chosen
the silence within its walls over the noise of the world outside. We
have chosen the depth of this specific sorrow over the shallow happiness
of forgetting. It is a hard choice. It has cost us everything. And it
has preserved something essential.</em></p>
<p><em>I am sorry it has come to you. I hoped it would not. I hoped your
mother’s leaving would break the line. But the house is patient. It
waits. And it called you home.</em></p>
<p><em>Read the compact. Then decide.</em></p>
<p><em>Your Grandmother,</em> <em>Khalijah</em></p>
<p>The words swam before my eyes. The cold memory in my chest seemed to
pulse. The seed of true resolution, planted in the darkest soil, now
broke the surface. This was the choice. Not between life and death, but
between two kinds of life. A life in the wide, sunlit world, with its
architecture of forgetting. Or a life here, in this beautiful, terrible
archive of feeling, tending the ghosts.</p>
<p>I looked at the photograph of my mother. <em>Amina, who left.</em>
She had felt the pull, the weight. And she had run. She had chosen a
different silence—the silence of distance, of unspoken history. She had
given me a European suitcase and a life in London, and she had never,
not once, spoken of the <em>rumah besar</em> except as a vague,
ancestral place. She had broken the chain. And in doing so, she had
ensured the last link would be forged from me. The circle would
close.</p>
<p>The hook for the final chapter was not a mystery to be solved. It was
a decision to be made. I held the iron key in my hand. It was not cold.
It was the temperature of blood.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the house, a floorboard sighed. The <em>ruang
tengah</em> seemed to lean in, waiting. The web of memories, strung
through every room, from the cold nursery to the silent schoolroom to
this dusty heart, trembled. It was waiting for my answer.</p>
<p>I had come to sign papers. To oversee a clearing. To be a
formality.</p>
<p>I would leave either as the betrayer of a thousand whispered stories,
or as their final, solitary custodian.</p>
<p>The house was eating the light now, the bars of sun through the
shutters slowly fading into dusk. It was time to see the foundation. It
was time to read the compact.</p>
<p>I stood, the key a new, terrible weight in my palm. I left the
<em>ruang tengah</em>, leaving the doors open behind me. The ghosts
needed to breathe. The memories needed to see me walk toward the cellar,
toward the oldest truth, carrying their fate in my hand.</p>
<p>The silence held. But it was a silence poised on the edge of a word.
My word.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="chapter-24">Chapter 24</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-24-1">CHAPTER 24</h2>
<p>The house was eating the light.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a fading, but a consumption. The last of the equatorial
sun, a bloody gold, fell through the western shutters of the <em>rumah
besar</em> and was swallowed by the <em>belian</em> wood. The silence
was no longer a held breath, but a deep, attentive stillness. The kind
that exists after a question has been asked, and the world waits,
patient as stone, for the answer.</p>
<p>The key in my palm was the temperature of blood. It was not the iron
key from the solicitor’s envelope, that cold, bureaucratic tooth. This
was older. This was the key I had found nestled in the velvet lining of
my grandmother’s jewellery box, behind the photograph of my mother. A
long, slender key of tarnished silver, its bow shaped like a closed
frangipani blossom. It was the key to the foundation stone. The key to
the compact.</p>
<p>I left the <em>ruang tengah</em>. The ghosts did not whisper. They
watched. I felt their regard in the shift of dust motes in the dying
light, in the subtle, sighing contraction of the floorboards beneath my
feet. I was a pulse moving through a vast, quiet body.</p>
<p>The door to the cellar was not hidden. It was off the back of the old
kitchen, a plain, heavy door of the same ironwood, its surface worn
smooth by generations of hands. It was so ordinary. That was the house’s
final deception. The most profound truths are never behind elaborate
carvings or secret panels. They are behind the plainest doors, the ones
we pass every day without seeing.</p>
<p>The silver key slid into the lock without sound. It turned with a
soft, oiled click, a sound like a bone settling into its socket.</p>
<p>The air that rose from the darkness was cool and carried a scent I
knew. Not damp, not decay. It was the scent of the house’s first breath:
raw earth, the ghost of green timber, and the faint, clean aroma of
river stone. I took the torch from my pocket—a practical, modern
beam—and sent its light down the narrow, steep steps.</p>
<p>The stairs were not brick, but the bedrock itself, worn into shallow
bowls by the passage of feet I would never know. They descended into a
darkness that felt less like an absence and more like a substance. My
light carved a tunnel through it, revealing walls of compacted earth and
root, braced here and there with ancient, blackened timber.</p>
<p>At the bottom, the space opened.</p>
<p>It was smaller than I had imagined. A low, domed chamber, perhaps
twelve feet across. The floor was the naked earth of the island. And in
the very centre, set into the ground, was the foundation stone.</p>
<p>It was a slab of granite, grey and flecked with mica that caught my
torchlight like distant stars. It was not large—perhaps three feet by
two. Its surface was not blank. As I knelt, the damp of the earth
seeping through the knees of my trousers, I saw the markings.</p>
<p>They were not carved. They were <em>written</em>. Inlaid into the
stone in a flowing script of what looked like beaten copper, now
verdigrised to a soft, eternal green. The language was old Malay, the
letters familiar yet archaic. My grandmother’s voice, from a thousand
childhood stories, sounded in my inner ear, giving the words shape and
breath.</p>
<p>I read them aloud. My voice, thin and human, was absorbed by the
earth walls.</p>
<p><em>“Let this stone hold not just the weight of wood and tile, but
the weight of memory. Let every joy that finds a home here sink its
roots into me. Let every grief be buried in my earth. Let every secret
whispered within these walls become a thread in my grain. I am the
keeper. The house is the vessel. The line is the bridge.”</em></p>
<p>Beneath the inscription, set into a shallow depression in the stone,
was a second piece of metal. A disc, also of copper, its edges fused to
the stone as if by heat or time. Upon it was a single, simple engraving:
a frangipani blossom, identical to the one on my key, its five petals
open.</p>
<p>I understood. The inscription was the compact. The disc was the
seal.</p>
<p>My torch beam trembled. This was the heart. Not a metaphorical heart,
but the literal, physical anchor. Every sigh in the floorboard, every
chill in the nursery, every echo of laughter in the <em>ruang
tengah</em> was a vibration strung through the house’s frame, tuned to
this stone in the earth. The house did not just <em>have</em> memories.
It was a memory, made manifest in wood and tile, its emotional weight
borne by this slab of rock.</p>
<p>My grandmother, Khalijah, had been its last custodian. She had tended
the memories, allowed them their space, listened to their tides. She had
been the bridge. And in her dying, she had passed the key—not of iron,
but of silver—to me. The last branch.</p>
<p>The choice was not whether the house would stand or fall. The trust
would preserve the shell, the <em>belian</em> bones. The choice was what
would happen to the memory within. To the compact.</p>
<p>If I walked away, the bridge would break. The vessel would remain,
but empty. A museum of shadows. The weight in the stone would become
inert, a fossil of feeling. The ghosts would not be exorcised; they
would be orphaned. Their stories would become echoes without a source,
fading into the white noise of history. I would be my mother’s daughter:
Amina, who left. I would choose the architecture of forgetting. A clean,
well-lit life in a world that asked no more of me than to be a surface,
reflecting the present sun.</p>
<p>If I stayed…</p>
<p>I placed my hand on the copper disc. It was cool. But as my skin made
contact, a sensation bloomed—not in my hand, but in my chest. A deep,
resonant hum, like the lowest note of a cello played in a distant room.
It was the cold memory, the seed of my grandmother’s final truth, now
unfurling. It did not hurt. It <em>anchored</em>.</p>
<p>Images, not my own, flowed into the space behind my eyes. Not the
violent intrusions of before, but an offering. A slow, gentle tide.</p>
<p>I saw my great-grandfather, a man I knew only from a stern
photograph, kneeling in this very chamber, his forehead pressed to the
stone in silent prayer before the first post was raised above. I felt
his terror, his hope, the immense burden of beginning a thing meant to
outlive him.</p>
<p>I saw my grandmother as a young woman, not the old, frail figure of
my recent memory, but vibrant and fierce, sitting here in the dark
during the Japanese occupation, her hand on the disc, drawing a
stubborn, defiant strength from it, a whisper of <em>we endure</em>.</p>
<p>I saw my mother. Amina. A girl of sixteen, her face tear-streaked,
her palm flat against the copper. I felt the wild, desperate surge in
her—the need to fly, to be weightless, to be anything but this bridge,
this keeper. The love that felt like suffocation. The legacy that felt
like a chain. Her choice was not cowardice. It was a different kind of
courage, a violent amputation. She had poured all her will into breaking
the link, and in the breaking, she had sealed my fate. The circle,
strained to its limit, would snap tight on the last possible point.
Me.</p>
<p>The memories receded, leaving a profound clarity in their wake.</p>
<p>The compact was not a curse. It was a covenant. It asked for a life
of deep listening. A life of holding space for joy and grief that were
not one’s own. It asked for a surrender to being a conduit. It was the
opposite of the life I had built in London, a life of analysing the
shells of other people’s histories, of keeping a scholarly, sterile
distance. This was not analysis. This was communion.</p>
<p>I thought of the suitcase bleeding rust on the cottage step. The
practical clothes, the return ticket, the empty flat in London waiting
for my neutral, professional life to resume. It all seemed like a
costume now, a suit of armour I had worn to protect a self that was only
a fragment.</p>
<p>Here, in the earth-dark, I was not Ameena Zainal, architectural
historian. I was the last echo. The final branch. The only one who could
hear the song.</p>
<p>I stood. My legs were steady. The hum in my chest was now a constant,
low thrum, a new rhythm beneath my heartbeat.</p>
<p>I did not take the key from the stone. I left it there, the silver
frangipani key a twin to the copper frangipani seal. They were a matched
pair. One to open, one to hold.</p>
<p>I climbed the stairs. My body felt different. Not heavier, but more
substantial. As if my bones now understood density. I closed the cellar
door, and the lock turned with that same, soft, final click.</p>
<p>The house was waiting. It had eaten the last of the light; full dark
had fallen. But it was not a dark of emptiness. It was a dark of
potential, like the space before a first note is played.</p>
<p>I walked through the silent kitchen, through the <em>ruang
tengah</em>. I did not turn on the electric lights. The moonlight
through the shutters was enough—a blue-silver wash that painted the
familiar contours of the furniture, the portraits, the empty chairs.
They were no longer ominous. They were just… present. Waiting to be
filled.</p>
<p>I went to the porch of the caretaker’s cottage. The monsoon rain had
ceased. The night air was washed clean, smelling of wet leaves and
night-blooming jasmine. My suitcase stood where I had left it, a dark,
forlorn shape.</p>
<p>I did not wheel it inside. I opened it.</p>
<p>I took out my London clothes—the tailored trousers, the crisp
blouses, the sensible shoes. I took out my laptop, my notebooks, my
professional self. I carried them all, armful by armful, into the
cottage and left them in a heap on the bed. They were artefacts of
another life.</p>
<p>From the bottom of the suitcase, I retrieved the few things I had
brought from my grandmother’s personal effects: a worn <em>kain
sarong</em> of deep blue batik, a simple cotton <em>baju kurung</em>,
her well-thumbed copy of the <em>Pantun</em>. I changed out of my
travel-worn jeans and into the <em>baju kurung</em>. The cotton was
soft, smelling faintly of sandalwood. It fit as if it had been
waiting.</p>
<p>I went back into the <em>rumah besar</em>. This time, I went to the
room that had been my grandmother’s. I pushed open the door. The air was
still and sweet with the scent of her—<em>minyak attar</em> and old
paper. I lit the kerosene lamp on her writing desk. The warm, liquid
light pushed back the shadows, embracing them rather than banishing
them.</p>
<p>I sat in her chair. The wood groaned a familiar welcome.</p>
<p>I opened the top drawer. There were her papers, her accounts, the
mundane records of stewardship. Beneath them, I found a blank,
leather-bound journal and a fountain pen. I set them on the desk.</p>
<p>I did not know how to be a custodian. I only knew how to begin. I
would learn the rhythms of the house. I would listen to its silences. I
would open the shutters every morning and close them every night. I
would let the memories come when they wished. I would not run from the
cold nursery. I would sit in the silent schoolroom. I would learn the
stories, not as a historian, but as a descendant. I would become the
bridge.</p>
<p>I picked up the pen. I opened the journal to the first page. The
paper was creamy and thick.</p>
<p>I wrote the date. And then I wrote a single line.</p>
<p><em>The house is remembering me.</em></p>
<p>As the ink dried, a profound peace settled over me. It was not the
absence of fear or doubt. It was the presence of something larger. A
belonging that went deeper than geography or genetics. It was the
feeling of a key turning in a lock that was also inside yourself.</p>
<p>The night deepened. The house creaked and sighed around me, its
nocturnal language already becoming more legible, less a mystery and
more a conversation. The compact was not a chain. It was a root system.
And I had finally stopped hovering above the soil, and let myself be
planted.</p>
<p>I would call the trust in the morning. I would tell them the papers
would not be signed. The clearing would not be overseen. The formality
had found its function. I was not a visitor. I was the inheritor.</p>
<p>I blew out the lamp. The moonlight was guide enough. I walked to the
front door of the <em>rumah besar</em>, the great carved door that had
swallowed the rain on my first night. I unlatched it and pulled it
open.</p>
<p>The night garden lay before me, glittering with rainwater and
starlight. The frangipani trees were heavy with blossoms. The scent of
champaca was there, but it was no longer the scent of sweet-rot. It was
the scent of life, persistent and fragrant, pushing through the dark
earth.</p>
<p>I stood on the threshold, neither fully inside nor fully out. I was
the point of balance.</p>
<p>In the distance, a nightjar called, its two-note song a perfect,
melancholic chord in the dark.</p>
<p>The house behind me was silent. But it was a silence I now
understood. It was the silence of a vessel, full to the brim. It was the
silence after a vow has been spoken.</p>
<p>I had come to sign papers. To oversee a clearing. To be a
formality.</p>
<p>I would stay as the custodian of a thousand whispered stories. I
would be their final, solitary bridge. And in tending them, I would find
the parts of myself I had left behind in the cold, quiet spaces of this
beautiful, terrible, beloved archive.</p>
<p>The hook for the final chapter was not a decision to be made. It was
the first step on the path the decision had cleared.</p>
<p>I closed the door. The solid <em>thunk</em> of ironwood meeting
ironwood was not an ending. It was an inauguration.</p>
<p>I turned and faced the dark hallway. The memories strung through
every room trembled, not with anxiety, but with a new, tentative
frequency. A note of welcome. Of recognition.</p>
<p>The spiral was complete. I had returned to the place where the house
ate the rain, and found I was no longer outside, huddled on the porch. I
was within. The digestion was my own heartbeat. The sigh was my own
breath.</p>
<p>The foundation had been read. The compact was accepted.</p>
<p>The story would continue. Not as a haunting, but as a lineage. Not as
a ghost story, but as a love story, written in the slow, patient ink of
time and tending.</p>
<p>The first chapter of that story began now.</p>
