  "cover_prompt": "A weathered colonial-era Malaysian mansion at dusk, dark belian wood absorbing rain, shuttered windows like closed eyes, mist rising from surrounding jungle, a lone kerosene lamp glowing amber in one window, monsoon clouds gathering overhead. Rendered in the atmospheric style of Gustave Doré with watercolor textures. Book cover framing, centered composition, dramatic low angle. Soft diffused twilight with warm lamp glow contrast against cool blue mist. Masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution."
